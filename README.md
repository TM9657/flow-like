<h1 align="center">Flow-Like: Automate Your Work — See the Full Data Story</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>Any flow you like.</em>
</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

**🔒 Private by Default** • **⚡ Fast & Reliable** • **🧩 Drag-and-Drop Blocks** • **☁️ Works Solo or at Team Scale**

</div>

<br>

Flow-Like is a **visual workflow automation tool** that shows you not just *what* happens, but *why*. Build with drag-and-drop blocks and get a clear record of where data came from, what changed, and what came out — **no black boxes, no guesswork**.

### Why Flow-Like?

🚀 **Fully Typed Workflows** — Ready for projects of any size with type-safe data flows
🦀 **Built on Rust** — Uncompromising performance, efficiency, and code safety
🎯 **Zero-to-Prod** — The flow you sketch is the flow you ship — no rewrites needed
🤖 **AI-Powered** — Seamlessly integrate LLMs, ML models, and deterministic logic
🌐 **Portable** — Start offline, go online, deploy to Edge/Cloud/On-prem with one click
🤝 **Open Source** — Community-driven, enterprise-grade workflow operating system

<br>

## 🎯 What Makes Flow-Like Different

### The Challenge
Most workflow tools show a green checkmark and move on. You're left guessing where the data came from, what got filtered or transformed, and why the result looks the way it does.

### Our Solution: Typed Workflows with Data Trails
In Flow-Like, workflows are **fully typed** — they don't just describe *what happens*, but also *what data flows where* and *why*.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

**🔍 Data Origins**
See exactly where each piece of data came from — the email address, the file, the API response.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**⚙️ Transformations**
Every validation, enrichment, and reformatting step is visible and traceable.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**📋 Clear Contracts**
Type-safe input/output definitions prevent runtime surprises and breaking changes.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result:** Explainable workflows that stay shippable as they evolve — from prototype to production, with confidence.

## 🌐 Flow-Like Ecosystem

### 🎨 Visual Studio
Our innovative, **no-code workflow builder IDE**. Connect nodes with smart predictions, collapse complex logic into clean abstractions, and trace every execution with inline feedback.

<p align="center"><img width="800" src="./assets/recording.gif" alt="Visual Studio in Action"></p>

**Features:**
- 🎯 **Smart Wiring** — Pins know what they accept; miswired connections surface immediately
- 📊 **Inline Feedback** — See inputs, outputs, and timings at each step
- 🔄 **Live Validation** — Fix mistakes as you go, before they ship
- 📸 **Snapshots** — Reproduce issues and compare runs with saved states

---

### 🧩 Rich Node Catalog
Build workflows from **100+ execution nodes** — from branching and databases to AI models and higher-order agent nodes.

**Categories:**
- 🔗 APIs & Webhooks
- 🗄️ Databases & Storage
- 📁 Files & Processing
- 🤖 AI & Computer Vision
- 📨 Messaging & Queues
- 🌐 Devices & Sensors

[📄 Explore the Full Catalog →](https://docs.flow-like.com/)

## 🎛️ One Process, Three Perspectives

Flow-Like goes beyond simple automation — it's built for **end-to-end process orchestration** where every role sees the same truth in their own language.

<div align="center">

| 📋 Process View | 🔄 Data View | ⚙️ Execution View |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Who does what, when, and why**<br>Plain-English story for managers | **What came in, what changed, what went out**<br>Data transformations and lineage | **How the system runs it**<br>Technical implementation for IT |

</div>

### Layer Drill Down
- 📊 Show high-level business processes to stakeholders
- 🔍 Drill into detailed technical implementation one layer below
- 🌐 Manage cross-team and cross-system workflows without losing visibility

**Result:** Business logic and technical execution stay aligned, from strategy to deployment.
