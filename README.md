### Why Choose Flow-Like for Workflow Automation?

- 🚀 **Fully Typed Workflows** — Type-safe data flows ready for enterprise-scale projects
- 🦀 **Built on Rust** — High-performance workflow engine with uncompromising speed and safety
- 🎯 **Zero-to-Prod** — The workflow you design is production-ready — no rewrites needed
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Automation** — Seamlessly integrate LLMs, ML models, and traditional logic
- 🌐 **Deploy Anywhere** — Start offline, go online, deploy to Edge/Cloud/On-prem with one click

- 📜 **Source Available** — BSL license: likely free for your use case

<br>

## 🎯 What Makes Flow-Like Different from Other Workflow Automation Tools

### The Challenge with Traditional Workflow Automation
Most workflow automation tools show a green checkmark and move on. You're left guessing where the data came from, what got filtered or transformed, and why the result looks the way it does. Traditional tools lack the transparency and type safety needed for complex enterprise workflows.

### Our Solution: Typed Workflows with Complete Data Trails
In Flow-Like, workflows are **fully typed** — they don't just describe *what happens*, but also *what data flows where* and *why*. Every workflow automation includes complete lineage tracking and audit trails.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

**Data Origins**
See exactly where each piece of data came from — the email address, the file, the API response.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Transformations**
Every validation, enrichment, and reformatting step is visible and traceable.

</td>
<td width="33%">

**Clear Contracts**
Type-safe input/output definitions prevent runtime surprises and breaking changes.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result:** Explainable workflows that stay shippable as they evolve — from prototype to production, with confidence.
