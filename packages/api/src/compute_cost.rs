//! Execution rows carry wall clock duration, never money. The platform bills

//! serves a run with an x86_64 function holding 2 GB for the whole run plus an
//! arm64 function holding 1.2 GB for roughly half of it.

//! Deployments that size their functions differently scale the whole estimate
//! with `COMPUTE_COST_MULTIPLIER`; an unset or unusable value keeps the
//! reference sizing at `1.0`. The variable is read once and cached, so changing
//! it requires a restart.
