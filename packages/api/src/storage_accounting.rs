//! Retention for the object-accounting rows the AWS file tracker writes.
//!
//! A deleted object keeps a zero-size row so a redelivered S3 notification
//! cannot subtract its bytes a second time. That row is only worth keeping for
//! as long as the notification queue can still hand the event back: SQS drops a
//! message after at most 14 days, so a tombstone older than the retention
//! window guards against nothing. Deployments drive [`sweep_tombstones`]
//! through `POST /maintenance/run` (`state_cleanup` job); only the AWS file
//! tracker writes this table, so there is no ticker on long-lived hosts.
