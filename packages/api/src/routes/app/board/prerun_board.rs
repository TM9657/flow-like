//! Pre-run analysis endpoint for boards
//!
//! Returns information needed before executing a board:
//! - Runtime-configured variables that need values
//! - Required OAuth providers and scopes
//!
//! Frontends are expected to cache responses and revalidate in the
//! background using the `signature` field to detect drift.
