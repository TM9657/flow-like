//! Admin-triggered retention sweep for every bounded telemetry table.
//!
//! Long-running deployments (local, Kubernetes, docker-compose) host the
//! in-process ticker from `telemetry::sweeper`. Serverless deployments have no
//! such process, so a scheduler (e.g. an AWS EventBridge rule) calls this
//! endpoint instead. Both paths run the exact same `sweep_once`.
