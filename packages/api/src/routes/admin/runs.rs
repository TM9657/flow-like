//! Admin endpoints for run reconciliation.
//!
//! `POST /admin/runs/sweep` lets a scheduled job (e.g. an AWS
//! EventBridge Lambda) invoke `run_sweeper::sweep_once` against the
//! API's database, which is the only path that works in deployments
//! where the API runs on Lambda — there's no long-running process to
//! host the in-process ticker that lives in the local/k8s/docker-compose
//! mains.
