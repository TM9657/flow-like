//! Compile-only stand-ins for WASM nodes.
//!
//! Compiling a board needs each node's `Node` definition — pins, defaults,
//! permissions — and nothing else; the registry fingerprint that binds an
//! artifact to a node catalog hashes those definitions alone. For WASM nodes
//! the API already holds them: the compiler workload instantiates each
//! uploaded module in its own sandbox, calls its `get_nodes` export, and
//! reports the result back, which the compilation callback stores in
//! `wasm_package_version.nodes`. Reading that row is the API's entire contact
//! with a WASM package — it never loads module bytes, so a sandbox escape in
//! user WASM cannot reach API credentials. The logic here exists only to fill
//! the registry's `(Node, NodeLogic)` shape and refuses to run.
//!
//! The row is only as good as the callback that wrote it, but a wrong row
//! cannot make a wrong artifact run: the executor derives its nodes from the
//! real module and rejects any artifact whose fingerprint disagrees.
