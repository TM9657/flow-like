 * The runtime half of `EVENT_CONFIG`: which event types a running app can render, and with

 *
 * `EVENT_CONFIG` also carries every event *configuration* panel, and reaching it pulls the
 * whole builder — the flow editor, the code editors, the chart libraries — into whatever
 * imports it. `/use` renders none of that, so it imports this instead, by module path rather
 * than through the package barrel. Both must list the same event types: a type present here
 * without an interface simply never renders.
