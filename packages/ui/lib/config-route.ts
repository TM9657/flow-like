/**
 * Config sections that own their vertical space instead of scrolling the page:
 * storage browsers, Data Studio and the app stylesheet editor render their own
 * scroll containers, so the layout must hand them a flex-sized slot rather than
 * an auto-height one — a code editor sized `h-full` inside an auto-height slot
 * collapses to nothing.
 *
 * Matched per path segment — a substring check on `/storage` silently misses
 * `/user-storage`, which collapses that page's height.
