# Flow-Like Kubernetes Backend

Production-ready Kubernetes deployment using Helm with built-in observability.

## Quick Start

**Local development (k3d):**
```bash
cd apps/backend/kubernetes
./scripts/k3d-setup.sh
```

**Production:**
```bash
helm install flow-like ./helm -n flow-like --create-namespace \
  --set storage.external.endpoint='https://s3.example.com' \
  --set storage.external.accessKeyId='YOUR_KEY' \
  --set storage.external.secretAccessKey='YOUR_SECRET'
```

## Build Caching

The Dockerfiles use BuildKit cache mounts for faster rebuilds. Build scripts automatically enable BuildKit.

**First build:** ~15-20 minutes (full compilation)
**Subsequent builds:** ~1-3 minutes (incremental)

To clear the build cache:
```bash
docker builder prune --filter type=exec.cachemount
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n flow-like

# View logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/flow-like-api -n flow-like

# Get Grafana password
kubectl get secret flow-like-grafana -n flow-like \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d && echo

# Upgrade Helm release
helm upgrade flow-like ./helm -n flow-like

# Uninstall
helm uninstall flow-like -n flow-like
```

## Local Development Access (k3d)

After running `./scripts/k3d-setup.sh`, services are available at:

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| API | http://localhost:8080 | NodePort (automatic) |
| Grafana | http://localhost:30002 | NodePort, default login: admin/admin |
| Registry | http://localhost:5111 | Local Docker registry |

## Production Access

For production, use port-forwarding or configure ingress:

```bash
# Port-forward API
kubectl port-forward -n flow-like svc/flow-like-api 8080:8080

# Port-forward Grafana
kubectl port-forward -n flow-like svc/flow-like-grafana 3000:80
