	"pricing.faq.a1":
		"We'll notify you when you're approaching your limits. You can upgrade anytime, and we won't suddenly cut off your workflows. For cloud executions, additional usage is billed at a pay-as-you-go rate.",
	"pricing.faq.q2": "Can I self-host Flow-Like?",
	"pricing.faq.a2":
		"Yes! Flow-Like is fully self-hostable. You can run it on your own infrastructure, on-premise, or in air-gapped environments. The desktop app works entirely offline — no cloud connection required for local execution.",
	"pricing.faq.q3": "Is there per-seat or per-user pricing?",
	"pricing.faq.a3":
		"No. We believe automation should be accessible to your entire organization. All plans support unlimited users. You only pay based on usage (cloud features), not headcount.",
	"pricing.faq.q4": "What's included in AI model access?",
	"pricing.faq.a4":
		"AI model access covers features like FlowPilot (our AI assistant), intelligent workflow suggestions, and natural language automation through our hosted models.",
	"pricing.faq.q5": "Do you offer discounts for startups or non-profits?",
	"pricing.faq.a5":
		"Yes! We offer significant discounts for registered non-profits, educational institutions, and early-stage startups. Contact us at hello@flow-like.com to learn more.",
	"pricing.faq.q6": "What's the difference between local and cloud execution?",
	"pricing.faq.a6":
		"Local execution runs workflows on your machine — completely free and unlimited on all plans. Cloud execution runs workflows on our infrastructure, enabling scheduled runs, webhooks, and 24/7 availability.",
	"pricing.faq.q7": "Can I cancel anytime?",
	"pricing.faq.a7":
		"Absolutely. No contracts, no cancellation fees. If you cancel, you'll retain access until the end of your billing period, then automatically downgrade to Free.",
	"pricing.faq.q8": "What about enterprise compliance requirements?",
	"pricing.faq.a8":
		"Enterprise plans include SOC 2 compliance documentation, GDPR data processing agreements, custom retention policies, audit logs, and SSO/SAML integration.",
