## UI Builder
- Dashboard Elements
- Custom Layouts
- Interactive Components
- FlowPilot for UI Generation
- Update, Delete & Create new UI Elements from your workflow - versioned together

Sharable Widgets for reuse and the nodes to control the frontend

## Business Intelligence (BI) Features
- Data Viz through dashboard building
- Integration of a robust DataFusion integration on node level
    - Let's you query your lancedb tables (database default implementation)
    - Ingest new data
    - Use Parquet ingest (time based aggregations, filters, etc)
    - Connection of Postgres, MySQL, and other databases through DataFusion connectors (ODBC, FlightSQL, etc) -> SnowFlake etc should also be supported
    - Athena Integration
    - S3 based data lake querying (Iceberg, Delta Lake, etc)
    - And more...
- Agent compatible, just hook one or multiple Sources into a DataFusion session and add the session to the agent

## WASM Nodes
- Rust and AssemblyScript templates for building custom WASM nodes
- Expanded node catalog with new functionalities without adjusting the source code
-> Very early stage, expect better documentation and functionality next release

## Runtime Variables
- You can now user specific runtime variables. E.g your workflow execution requires a custom user API key -> define and let user set it at runtime (stored only local, never shared with backend)

## Node Updates
- Open Database now supports user scoped databases (secure by design)
- Improved Document Extraction + summarization options -> source for this is open source here:  https://github.com/TM9657/markitdown-rs
- New Web Nodes (standard Headers)
- New Default Node (Checks for value, if invalid -> use default value pin)
- Create QR Code Node
- Remove field from Struct Node
- Faker Nodes: For mocking data efficiently
- Geo Location Nodes: Want to get an image of certain coordinates or use the same coordination system as Uber? Now you can with our Geo Location Nodes (H3, Geocoding, etc)


## Notification System
- In-App Notifications for workflow executions, system updates, errors, and more
- Configurable notification settings -> Notify yourself when something in the background workflow happens / Notify a specific team member when something happens (has to be part of the project)

## Clear Board Execution settings
- You can now define where the workflow runs (locally, remote or hybrid)
- This change also introduces local only nodes which would force execution locally (e.g. Computer and Browser Use, File System Nodes, etc)
- If you run a shared workflow containing secret variables locally, you will be prompted to enter the secret too. The backend never returns the secret to the frontend for security reasons.

## Some UI and UX Improvements
- Improved project creation, removed the old way of doing that.
- Faster navigation through quick search / spotlight
- More information about current execution
- In workflows you can quickly create variables from pins (carrying over their schema for schema save variable handling)
- Make and Break struct based nodes if they have a pin. No need to manually set the field with x nodes, just one make and break.

## Documentation updates & code base changes
- New docs for our new features
- Frontend for the desktop app was moved into ui components as preparation for the Web App.
- Leaner Backend (Gated Execution for Nodes with feature flags, so these crates and code is not loaded into backend compilation)

### Updated Dependencies
- LanceDB upgraded to latest version
- DataFusion upgraded to latest version
- Rig upgraded to latest version
