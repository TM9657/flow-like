Let’s be honest for a second. How many "great ideas" for automation are currently gathering dust in your backlog?

You know the ones. *"We really should automate those invoice emails."* *"Someone needs to script a bridge between the shop floor sensors and Teams."* *"Why doesn't our internal wiki update itself when we push code?"*

They are great ideas. They would save you hours every week. But they never happen because, well, *life happens*. You’re busy building the product, putting out fires, or just trying to survive the week. Setting up a new automation tool, learning the syntax, and debugging API keys feels like a mountain you don’t have time to climb.

**We are here to climb it for you.**

### The Challenge

We are launching **The Flow-Like 24-Hour Solution**.

The deal is simple. You tell us your problem—the boring, repetitive, soul-crushing task that eats up your team's time. We will build a production-ready Flow-Like prototype to solve it. **In 24 hours.**

No lengthy consulting contracts. No weeks of discovery calls. Just you, us, and a solved problem by this time tomorrow.

To prove we aren't bluffing, here is a taste of what we can build in a single day.

### 1. The "Inbox Zero" Dream (Mail Automation)
**The Problem:** Your "Orders" inbox is a war zone. PDF invoices, random supplier updates, and "urgent" requests are piled high. You have poor Bob from accounting manually opening attachments and typing numbers into Excel. Bob hates this. We hate this for Bob.

**The 24-Hour Build:**
We build an intelligent agent that watches your inbox like a hawk.
* **It reads:** It scans every incoming email.
* **It thinks:** It identifies if the attachment is an Invoice, a Quote, or junk.
* **It acts:** It extracts the vendor name, date, and total, pushes it directly into your ERP (or a tidy Excel sheet), and moves the email to a "Processed" folder.
Bob gets his sanity back. You get accurate data instantly.

### 2. The Self-Healing Brain (Company Knowledge Base)
**The Problem:** Your engineering team moves fast. So fast that your internal documentation on Notion or Confluence is obsolete approximately 10 minutes after it’s written. New hires are confused, and senior devs are tired of answering the same questions.

**The 24-Hour Build:**
We wire up a Flow-Like watcher to your GitHub repository.
* **The Trigger:** When a Pull Request is merged, the flow wakes up.
* **The Smarts:** It diffs the code, realizes you changed the API signature, and *automatically drafts an update* to the relevant Notion page.
* **The Result:** Your documentation lives and breathes alongside your code. No more "deprecated" confusion.

### 3. The Shopfloor Sentry (Industrial Automation)
**The Problem:** Machine #4 overheats every Tuesday, but nobody notices until smoke comes out. By then, the batch is ruined. You have sensors, but the data is locked in a database nobody looks at.

**The 24-Hour Build:**
We bridge the gap between your hardware and your humans.
* **The Pulse:** A flow polls your MQTT broker or SQL database every minute.
* **The Logic:** "Is Temp > 90°C AND Vibration > 5mm?"
* **The Alarm:** If yes, it instantly blasts a red alert to the #maintenance channel on Teams or Slack, tagging the on-call engineer with a live graph of the last 10 minutes.
Crisis averted. Production saved.
