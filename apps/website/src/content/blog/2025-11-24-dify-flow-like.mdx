## What is Flow-Like?

**Flow-Like** is a typed, local-first automation platform built for teams who treat workflows like software. It's designed for scenarios where data consistency, offline capability, and long-term maintainability matter.

### Flow-Like's Core Strengths

**Typed Dataflow**
Every connection declares its data shape—type errors surface at design time, not in production. Applies to all operations: traditional data processing, API calls, file operations, AND AI/ML workflows (embeddings, LLM inputs/outputs, RAG pipelines).

**Local-First & Offline-Capable**
Runs natively on macOS, Windows, Linux, and **iOS**. No cloud dependency—deploy to air-gapped environments, edge devices, or field operations. Run local LLMs, RAG pipelines, and agents completely offline.

**Built-In State & Storage**
SQL and vector databases included—no external infrastructure for RAG, semantic search, or data operations. Files are first-class citizens with atomic operations. Build complete AI systems without external dependencies.

**Universal LLM Support + RAG + Agents**
Connect to any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, custom endpoints). Built-in RAG with vector search, chunking, and retrieval. Create AI agents with tool calling and multi-step workflows—all with type safety.

**Rust-Fast Performance**
Handles massive datasets with streaming and back-pressure—process multi-GB files or batch 10M+ LLM operations with minimal memory footprint. Built for high-throughput production workloads.

**Multi-Domain Automation**
Not just GenAI—seamlessly mix AI operations with ETL, API integrations, file processing, and IoT automation in one typed workflow. One platform for all automation needs.

**Team Collaboration & Governance**
Real-time co-editing, RBAC, environment management (dev/stage/prod), audit logs, and version control. Built for teams building production systems with compliance requirements.

## Can They Work Together?

**Absolutely!** Dify and Flow-Like are highly complementary:

### Dify as the GenAI Layer
Use Dify for LLM orchestration, RAG pipelines, and conversational AI—it excels at managing prompts, context, and agent behavior.

### Flow-Like as the Data Processing & Integration Layer
Use Flow-Like for data preparation, traditional automation, API integrations, and complex business logic that feeds into or consumes from AI systems.

### Integration Pattern
- **Flow-Like → Dify**: Prepare data in Flow-Like (ETL, validation, enrichment) → send to Dify via API for LLM processing
- **Dify → Flow-Like**: AI-generated outputs from Dify → trigger Flow-Like workflows for downstream actions (database updates, notifications, file generation)
- **Shared State**: Both can access common databases, vector stores, or file systems as integration points
- **MCP Integration**: Flow-Like workflows can expose data as MCP servers that Dify agents can consume

**Example Workflow:**
Flow-Like ingests customer support tickets from multiple sources → processes and enriches data → sends to Dify RAG pipeline for AI-powered response generation → Dify agent analyzes sentiment and suggests actions → Flow-Like receives outputs, updates CRM, and triggers appropriate business workflows

## The Honest Trade-Offs

### Dify Trade-Offs

**GenAI-Only Focus**
Purpose-built for LLM applications—not designed for traditional data pipelines, ETL, or non-AI automation. Need complementary tools for broader automation needs.

**No Type Safety**
Dynamic data flow without compile-time checks—errors surface at runtime. Changes to data structure require careful manual testing.

**Cloud or Self-Host Only**
No native desktop or mobile apps—requires server deployment. Not suitable for offline or edge scenarios.

**Limited Multi-Domain**
Excels at AI workflows but lacks built-in capabilities for complex data operations, high-volume streaming, or IoT integration.

### Flow-Like Trade-Offs

**Learning Curve**
Type system and platform concepts require more upfront investment than pure no-code tools.

**Fewer Pre-Built Templates**
Smaller community means fewer ready-made AI workflows and integrations in the marketplace compared to Dify's ecosystem.

**Smaller Community**
Younger platform with a smaller (but growing) community—fewer shared examples and templates available.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No-Code Conversational Chatbot
**Best Choice: Dify**
Non-technical team needs to quickly build a RAG-powered chatbot with conversation memory? Dify's pure no-code interface, conversational UI, and instant deployment get you running in minutes.

### Scenario 2: Production RAG System with Data Processing
**Best Choice: Flow-Like**
Build a typed RAG pipeline that ingests data from APIs/databases, transforms and validates it, generates embeddings, stores in vector DB, and serves queries—all with type safety and offline capability. Single platform for the entire stack.

### Scenario 3: AI Agent with Complex Business Logic
**Best Choice: Flow-Like**
Build an agent that mixes LLM calls with database queries, API integrations, file operations, and business rules—all type-safe. Flow-Like handles complex multi-domain automation that goes beyond pure AI orchestration.

### Scenario 4: Rapid AI Prototype for Validation
**Best Choice: Dify**
Startup needs to test an AI product idea quickly without developers. Dify's no-code builder and instant API deployment let non-technical founders validate concepts and demo to investors fast.

### Scenario 5: High-Volume AI Processing
