Alpha **v0.0.6** represents a quantum leap for Flow-Like. This isn't just an update; it’s a transformation. We have introduced an AI-powered assistant to help you build (**FlowPilot**), a dedicated system for creating autonomous agents (**Agent Builder**), and the long-awaited **Real-Time Collaboration** engine.

On top of that, we've shipped **over 5 integration suites**, including Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, and GitHub, alongside powerful developer tools like the Monaco Editor and native tool calling.

## Highlights

- **FlowPilot (#373)** — Your AI partner for building and editing workflows intelligently.
- **Agent Builder (#389)** — A dedicated interface for designing and deploying autonomous AI agents.
- **Real-Time Collaboration (#338)** — Build together with live cursors and instant sync.
- **Massive Node Library** — Native nodes for **Microsoft Office**, **Google Workspace**, **GitHub**, **Notion**, and **Atlassian**.
- **Dev Tools** — **Monaco Editor** integration, **MCP Client** node, and **Native Tool Calling**.
- **Chat Improvements** — "Thinking" visualization for reasoning models and Markdown support in logs.

## AI & Agents

### FlowPilot
Building complex flows just got easier. **FlowPilot** is our new AI assistant embedded directly into the editor. It understands your graph context and can help you generate nodes, refactor logic, and explain complex sections of your workflow.

### Agent Builder
We are moving beyond simple chains. The new **Agent Builder** allows you to construct sophisticated agents with persistent state and complex reasoning capabilities.
- **Native Tool Calling (#309):** Agents can now natively call tools defined in your graph.
- **Function References (#360):** Pass functions dynamically between nodes, enabling higher-order agentic behaviors.
- **Reasoning Tokens (#394):** See the "thinking" process of reasoning models (like o1 or r1) directly in the chat interface.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Work doesn't happen in a silo, and now, neither does Flow-Like.
- **Live Sync:** Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for everyone else.
- **Presence:** See who is currently viewing or editing the project.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Our new backend ensures smooth merging of edits even during intense co-creation sessions.

## New Integrations

We have dramatically expanded the ecosystem with **5 new major node suites**, allowing you to automate your entire office stack:

* **Microsoft Office Nodes (#409):** Automate Excel, Word, and Outlook directly from your flow.
* **Google Workspace Nodes (#408):** Read/write to Sheets, Docs, and manage Calendar events.
* **GitHub Nodes (#412):** Automate PRs, issues, and repository management.
* **Notion Nodes (#411):** specialized nodes for managing Notion databases and pages.
* **Atlassian Nodes (#413):** Jira and Confluence automation built-in.
* **MCP Client Node (#278):** Support for the Model Context Protocol to connect any MCP-compliant tool.

## Developer Experience & Core

### Enhanced Editor
- **Monaco Editor (#393):** We've integrated the Monaco Editor (VS Code's engine) for all code editing and file previews. Writing Python/JS snippets or editing text files is now a first-class experience.
- **Editable Text Files (#416):** You can now directly edit simple text files in the storage tab.
- **Node Detail Overview (#384):** A redesigned panel to view node properties and state clearly.

### Logging & Debugging
- **Markdown in Logs (#386):** Logs now render Markdown, making it easier to read rich output from LLMs or complex data structures.
- **Improved Logging Node (#341):** More control over what gets logged and how.

### Core Architecture
- **Rig Implementation (#327):** We replaced our legacy GenAI implementation with **Rig**, a more robust and flexible library for handling LLM interactions.
- **Third-Party Logins (#110):** A simplified way to manage OAuth and authentication for all the new external integrations.
- **Struct Improvements (#48, #62):** Added generic "Make" and "Break" nodes for Structs, plus Dot Notation support for easier field access.

## Bug Fixes

We squashed countless bugs to ensure stability:
- **Undo/Redo (#392):** Fixed inconsistencies where undo would sometimes fail or desync.
- **Large Files (#253):** Frontend no longer crashes when trying to display or process large text files.
- **Focus Node Bug (#401):** Fixed issues where the editor would lose focus on the active node.
- **Context Menu (#378):** Right-click no longer accidentally places nodes immediately.

## What's Next

With the foundation of Agents and Collaboration in place, we are looking forward to:
- **Refining FlowPilot:** Making the assistant even smarter.
- **More MCP Integrations:** Expanding the universe of available tools.
- **Stability & Performance:** optimizing the new collaboration engine.
