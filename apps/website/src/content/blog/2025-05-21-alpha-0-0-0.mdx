Today we’re shipping the **very first alpha of Flow-Like**. It’s the foundation we’ll build on together—good enough to try, rough enough to improve. Thank you to everyone who starred the repo, filed issues, and nudged us forward. You rock. 🙌

> ⚠️ Alpha quality: This build is for testing and feedback, not production. Please kick the tires and tell us where it breaks (politely). ([GitHub][1])

## Highlights

* **First version for workflow creation**
  Create and run basic workflows—this is the core we’ll iterate on.

* **Basic offline functionality**
  Try Flow-Like without a constant network connection; handy for local experimentation.
