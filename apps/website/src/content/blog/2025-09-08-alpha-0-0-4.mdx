Alpha **v0.0.4** doubles down on *real-world spreadsheets* and *practical ML*. Extract clean tables from Excel in one step, automate sheets with a focused Excel toolkit, and train/predict with new Machine Learning nodes — all inside typed, composable flows.

## Highlights

- **Machine Learning Nodes (Major)** — Train **K-Means**, **SVM Classifier**, **Linear Regression**; **Predict**; **Save/Load** models — designed for tabular flows ([PR #257](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/pull/257)).
- **Excel Table Extraction (XLSX)** — Detects headers/regions and emits **typed rows** ready for downstream nodes. No preview; straight to data.
- **Excel Node Toolkit** — Read/write cells, add/copy sheets, insert/remove rows & columns, list sheet names, and more (full list below).
- **Profiles & Themes** — Per-profile app visibility and theme selection.
- **Desktop Auto-Updates** — In-app updates via the Tauri updater (macOS/Windows/Linux).
- **Performance & Stability** — Faster big graphs; better long-run reliability.
- **Default Logging = `info`** — New flows start calmer (enable `debug` when needed).
- **Apple Login Fixed**.
- **Docs Refresh** — Clearer *Getting Started* and expanded node pages.

## Excel, Done Right

### Intelligent Excel Table Extraction
Drop in an `.xlsx` → get **typed rows**. The extractor finds well-formed tabular regions, detects headers, and handles empty margins and messy edges. Perfect for piping into database/vector/search nodes or straight into ML.

**Node:**
- **Try Extract Tables (Excel)** — Detect and emit `Array<Struct>` records from a worksheet.

### Excel Nodes in v0.0.4
A compact, consistent set that covers common spreadsheet automations:

- **Read Cell** — A1 or (row, col) addressing; returns string/number/bool when possible
- **Write Cell** — Write any typed value to a cell
- **Insert Row** / **Remove Row** — Structural row edits
- **Insert Column** / **Remove Column** — Structural column edits
- **New Worksheet** — Create a new sheet
- **Copy Worksheet** — Duplicate a worksheet (data + layout)
- **Get Sheet Names** — Enumerate sheets for routing/UX
- **Buffered CSV Reader** — Efficient CSV ingestion that fits the same table-first workflow

> Pair with **Local Database** nodes (Full-Text / Vector / Hybrid Search) to blend spreadsheets, search, and embeddings.

## Machine Learning

We are shipping a practical ML set tailored to **typed, tabular workflows** — efficient locally, easy to wire into production flows.

### Included in v0.0.4

**Training**
- **K-Means (Train)** — Unsupervised clustering for numeric features
- **SVM Classifier (Train)** — Supervised classification
- **Linear Regression (Train)** — Classic regression for continuous targets

**Inference & Persistence**
- **Predict (Model, Rows)** — Run predictions over arrays of structs/vectors; emits typed outputs (class/label, score, or numeric)
- **Save Model** / **Load Model** — Portable model checkpoints (JSON-backed) for repeatable deploys and A/Bs

**Design Goals**
- **Typed pins** end-to-end (features, labels, predictions)
- **Composable** with Database, Embeddings, and String/Math utilities
- **Local-first** behavior that is predictable and debuggable

**Example Flow (Sketch)**

`Read/Extract (Excel)` → `Feature Map (Types)` → `Train (SVM)` → `Save Model`
→ `Load Model` → `Predict` → `Upsert to DB / Export CSV`

## Builder Quality of Life

**Default: `info` logging** for new flows — keep noise low; switch to `debug` when investigating. If you still have old flows in `debug`, check if `info` is sufficient. Logging comes with a cost.

---

## Themes, Profiles & App Visibility

Create **profiles** to separate personal/team work, pick which **apps are visible** per profile, and apply **different themes** or create your own.

---

## Desktop Auto-Updates

This will be the last update you have to download manually. Flow-Like now supports **in-app updates** via the [Tauri Updater](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/) (macOS/Windows/Linux).

---

## Performance & Stability

- **Large Graphs**: faster execution paths, fewer allocations, improved back-pressure in I/O
- **Long-Running Flows**: better memory behavior and logging resilience

---

## Fixes & Smaller Improvements

- **Apple Login** stability fix
- **Default Logging** now **`info`** for new flows
- **Docs Additions** across *Getting Started*, *Local Database* search nodes, and utilities
