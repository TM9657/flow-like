Alpha **v0.0.5** is our most ambitious release yet. After seven weeks of intense development, we're thrilled to ship **Flow-Like on iOS**, a comprehensive **Event System** for workflow automation, **real-time collaboration**, and a suite of improvements that make building and running flows faster, more powerful, and more accessible.

## Highlights

- **iOS App (Major)** — Native execution on your device, remote LLM access, seamless sync with Desktop (TestFlight coming soon).
- **Event System (Major)** — Trigger workflows via **Cron**, **HTTP webhooks**, **Discord events**, and more.
- **Real-Time Collaboration** — See teammates' cursors, efficient syncing, co-edit workflows live.
- **Personal Access Tokens** — Automate and integrate via API (documentation coming soon).
- **Remote Model Service** — Free rate-limited models available now; Pro/Premium tiers launching soon.
- **Node Improvements** — Dot notation for fields, OpenAI node with custom keys, flexible `print`/`warning`/`error` nodes.
- **Performance & Fetching** — Faster data loading, better execution performance.
- **Bug Fixes** — Online project creation, interface polish, and stability wins.

## Flow-Like on iOS

We're bringing the full Flow-Like experience to **iOS**. Build, execute, and monitor workflows directly on your iPhone or iPad — with the same typed, composable power you know from Desktop.

### What's Included

- **Native Execution** — Runs locally on your device; no cloud dependency for core flows
- **Remote LLMs** — Access powerful language models through our remote service (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more)
- **Desktop Sync** — Flows, profiles, and data stay in sync across Desktop and iOS
- **Mobile-Optimized UI** — Touch-friendly canvas, redesigned for smaller screens without compromising functionality

### TestFlight Access

The iOS app will be available via **TestFlight soon**. We'll publish a dedicated blog post with installation instructions, feature walkthrough, and early-access details. Stay tuned!

## Event System — Automate Everything

The new **Event System** transforms Flow-Like into a true automation platform. Trigger workflows on schedules, HTTP requests, Discord messages, and more — all with typed event payloads that flow naturally into your nodes.

### Supported Event Types

#### **Cron Jobs**
Schedule workflows to run automatically. Perfect for:
- Daily data syncs
- Recurring reports
- Cleanup tasks
- Periodic ML model retraining

**Example:** `0 9 * * MON` → weekly Monday 9am report generation

#### **HTTP Events**
Expose workflows as webhooks. Trigger flows from:
- External services (Stripe, GitHub, Zapier)
- Custom integrations
- Internal microservices
- IoT devices

**Example:** Receive webhook → validate payload → process order → notify team

#### **Discord Events**
Build Discord bots directly in Flow-Like. React to:
- Messages
- Commands
- Reactions
- Member joins/leaves

**Use Cases:**
- AI-powered moderation bots
- Custom commands with LLM responses
- Multi-user interactive games/polls
- Server analytics and reporting

**Example Flow (Sketch):**
`Discord Message Event` → `LLM (ChatGPT)` → `Discord Reply` → `Log to Database`

#### **Coming Soon**
- **MQTT** — IoT and sensor data
- **Email** — Trigger on incoming mail
- **File System** — Watch folders for changes
- **Custom Webhooks** — Advanced routing and filtering

> All event payloads are **typed** and flow seamlessly into downstream nodes. No manual JSON parsing required.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Work on flows **together**. See your teammates' cursors in real-time, edit nodes simultaneously, and stay in sync with an efficient, conflict-free syncing mechanism.

### Features

- **Live Cursors** — See exactly where collaborators are working
- **Efficient Sync** — Minimal network overhead; works smoothly even on slower connections
- **Conflict-Free Editing** — Smart merge strategy ensures changes don't get lost
- **Instant Updates** — No manual refresh; changes appear as they happen

Perfect for:
- Pair programming workflows
- Teaching/demos
- Distributed team collaboration
- Live debugging sessions

---

## Personal Access Tokens & API Access

Automate your Flow-Like experience with **Personal Access Tokens**. Trigger workflows, manage projects, and integrate with external systems programmatically.

**API documentation coming soon** — covering endpoints for:
- Workflow execution
- Project management
- Event subscriptions
- Model service access

Use cases:
- CI/CD pipelines that trigger flows
- External dashboards pulling Flow-Like data
- Scheduled tasks via your own infrastructure
- Custom integrations with internal tools

---

## Remote Model Service

Access powerful LLMs without managing API keys or infrastructure. Our **Remote Model Service** provides:

### Available Now

- **Free Tier** — Rate-limited access to popular models (requires login)

Perfect for prototyping, learning, and low-volume production.

### Coming Soon

- **Pro Tier** — Higher rate limits, priority access, advanced models
- **Premium Tier** — Dedicated compute, custom fine-tuning, enterprise SLA

No credit card required for Free tier. Just log in and start building.

---

## Node Improvements

### Dot Notation for Field Access
Access nested struct fields naturally:

```
user.profile.name
data.items[0].price
response.meta.timestamp
```

Works across all nodes that accept field selectors — cleaner flows, less manual mapping.

### OpenAI Node with Custom Keys
Use your **own OpenAI API key** in the OpenAI node. Great for:
- Teams with existing OpenAI subscriptions
- Fine-tuned models
- Dedicated rate limits
- Cost tracking through your own account

### Flexible Print/Warning/Error Nodes
`print`, `warning`, and `error` nodes now accept **any generic value** — not just strings.

Pass in:
- Structs → formatted JSON
- Arrays → pretty-printed lists
- Numbers, booleans → direct output
- Mixed types → intelligent formatting

Faster debugging without manual `toString` conversions.

### Parallel Iteration (Experimental)
Iterate over arrays with parallel execution where safe. Significant speedups for:
- Batch LLM calls
- HTTP requests to multiple endpoints
- Database upserts
- File I/O operations

Automatically respects data dependencies and execution order.

---

## Performance & Fetching

### Improved Fetching Strategy
- **Faster initial loads** — smarter prefetching and caching
- **Better performance** — reduced memory allocations in execution hot paths
- **Smoother canvas** — improved rendering for large graphs

**Result:** Noticeably snappier experience, especially on large projects and slower connections.

---

## Bug Fixes & Polish

### Online Project Creation
Fixed: Creating online projects without a "Bit" (data source) now works correctly.

### Interface Improvements
- Cleaner node connection visuals
- Better zoom/pan behavior
- Fixed edge cases in field mapping UI
- Improved error message clarity

---

## What's Next

This release sets the stage for:
- **iOS TestFlight** (separate announcement coming)
- **API documentation** and integration guides
- **Pro/Premium model tiers**
- **More event types** (MQTT, Email, File System)

---

## Community & Thanks

A massive thank you to everyone who's been testing, reporting issues, and sharing ideas. The feedback from the r/selfhosted community continues to shape Flow-Like's direction.

Special thanks to early testers who helped shake out bugs in the iOS build and event system — your input made this release possible.
