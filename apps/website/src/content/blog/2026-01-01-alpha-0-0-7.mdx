Alpha **v0.0.7** is a foundational release for Flow-Like.
While v0.0.6 focused on *capabilities* (agents, collaboration, integrations), **v0.0.7 focuses on deployability, operational control, and extensibility**.

This is the **self-hosting release**.

Flow-Like can now be run on infrastructure you control — from a single-machine homelab setup to a production Kubernetes cluster — with officially supported deployment configurations, observability built in, and a desktop app that can connect to a custom backend with minimal configuration.

In addition, this release includes major UX improvements, developer-facing build optimizations, and a broad expansion of node functionality.

## Highlights

- **Self-Hosting Support** — Kubernetes Helm charts and Docker-Compose setups
- **Built-in Observability** — Tracing, metrics, and ready-to-use Grafana dashboards
- **Storage Freedom** — AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, GCP Storage, Azure Blob, and self-hosted S3 (MinIO)
- **Backend-Agnostic Desktop App** — One env var to connect to your own backend
- **UX Improvements** — Faster navigation, pinned tabs, cleaner project creation
- **Developer Experience Improvements** — Faster catalog compile times, smaller binaries
- **New Nodes & Capabilities** — Calendars, keyword extraction, dates, better tables
- **FlowPilot Enhancements** — One-click node explanations with full context

## Self-Hosting: From Laptop to Kubernetes

Flow-Like now provides **official, supported self-hosting setups**.

### Kubernetes Support
We ship **Kubernetes Helm charts** covering:
- API services
- Execution/runtime services
- Authentication and user management
- Storage backends
- Database wiring
- Ingress and TLS-ready setups

All Kubernetes deployments include:
- **Distributed tracing**
- **Metrics endpoints**
- **Preconfigured Grafana dashboards** for system health, execution behavior, and performance

The charts are designed to work on:
- Managed Kubernetes (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Bare-metal clusters
- Lightweight distributions (k3s, microk8s)

### Docker-Compose (Homelab & Dev)
For smaller installations, we provide **Docker-Compose setups**:
- Suitable for homelabs, local development, and small teams
- Minimal operational overhead
- Transparent service topology

Docker-Compose deployments also include:
- Metrics collection
- Tracing support
- Ready-to-import Grafana dashboards

---

## Documentation Updates

Self-hosting documentation has been expanded substantially:
- Deployment walkthroughs (Docker & Kubernetes)
- Storage backend configuration
- Observability setup and dashboard usage
- Environment variable reference
- Architecture and execution model explanations

Self-hosting is **supported**, but remains **optional** — hosted deployments and local-first usage continue to be first-class.

---

## Desktop App: Bring Your Own Backend

The Flow-Like desktop app is now **backend-agnostic**.

By setting **a single environment variable**, the desktop application can:
- Connect to a self-hosted backend
- Authenticate against custom infrastructure
- Execute workflows using user-controlled storage and compute

This enables:
- Air-gapped deployments
- Enterprise-controlled environments
- Hybrid local-first + server execution setups

No forks or custom builds required.

---

## Storage Backends: Beyond AWS

Storage is now fully **pluggable and cloud-agnostic**.

Supported backends:
- **AWS S3**
- **Cloudflare R2**
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Self-Hosted S3-Compatible Storage** (e.g. MinIO)

All backends share the same abstraction layer:
- Identical runtime behavior
- Portable workflows
- No provider-specific logic in graphs

Workflows remain file-based, movable, and executable across environments without modification.

---

## UX Improvements

This release includes multiple UX changes focused on navigation speed and clarity.

### Project Creation
- Project creation has been moved into a **sidebar modal**
- Reduced context switching during setup

### Global Spotlight
- A **global spotlight** enables fast navigation
- Jump directly to projects, nodes, and actions

### Pinned Tabs
- Tabs can now be **pinned to the sidebar**
- Designed for frequently accessed flows and files

### Node Context Handling
- Node context actions are no longer hidden behind right-click
- All actions are now accessible via a **toolbar above each node**

---

## Developer Experience & Core Changes

### Faster Node Catalog Compilation
The node catalog has been split into **multiple crates**:
- Faster incremental builds
- Better isolation during node development
- Cleaner dependency boundaries

This significantly improves iteration speed for contributors and core developers.

### Office Parsing: Custom, Faster, Smaller
We replaced Docling with a **custom Rust-native implementation**:
- Repository: https://github.com/TM9657/markitdown-rs
- Supports a wide range of Office formats
- Faster parsing performance
- Optional vision-model-based parsing
- Reduced application binary size by **several hundred MB**

---

## Node Execution & Auto-Generated Forms

Nodes with structured inputs now generate **automatic UI forms**:
- No raw JSON required by default
- Safer input handling
- Improved usability for non-technical users

JSON inputs remain available where appropriate.

---

## New Nodes & Capabilities

### Calendar & IMAP
- **IMAP Calendar Nodes**
- Subscribe to web calendars
- Read and process calendar data

### Keyword Extraction
New keyword extraction nodes:
- **YAKE**
- **RAKE**
- **AI-Based Keywords**

Designed for document pipelines, search, and semantic enrichment.

### Date & Time Nodes
- `Now`
- `Parse Date`
- Additional date utilities for temporal workflows

### Improved Table Management
Tables can now be managed visually:
- Add and modify columns
- Create and manage indexes
- Control optional vs required columns

---

## FlowPilot Improvements

FlowPilot now supports **one-click node explanations**:
- Explain any node instantly
- Responses include **full node context**
- Useful for onboarding, debugging, and large graphs

---

## Execution Throughput (Synthetic Benchmark)

To establish a baseline for the execution engine itself, we ran a **synthetic throughput benchmark** focused on the Flow-Like runtime core.

- **Flow-Like:** ~**255,000 executions / second**
  Measured as repeated execution of a minimal in-memory node chain, without external I/O, network calls, persistence, scheduling delays, or UI involvement.

- **n8n:** ~**200–220 workflow executions / second per instance**
  Based on n8n’s own published performance guidance and documentation.

Important context:
- These numbers **do not represent end-to-end automation throughput** and should not be interpreted as such.
- The benchmarks are **not directly comparable** due to different architectures, execution models, and definitions of “execution.”
- Real-world throughput is typically dominated by external systems (APIs, databases, storage latency), not engine dispatch speed.

The Flow-Like result is intended to demonstrate **execution headroom** of the core runtime, not typical production performance.

We plan to publish the benchmark harness, configuration, and workload definition to allow independent reproduction and comparison.

## What’s Next

With self-hosting and observability in place, upcoming work focuses on:

- **Web App** — A fully hosted, browser-based Flow-Like experience
- **Visual UI Builder** — Build custom frontends visually
- **AI-Assisted UI Generation** — Use FlowPilot to design and scaffold UIs

These will allow workflows to evolve into complete, user-facing applications with minimal glue code.
