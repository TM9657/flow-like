# FlowPilot app-creation E2E

The primary entry point is the repository-root CLI. It starts the real development Tauri runtime,
loads the existing webview runner, receives its result through a nonce-protected loopback callback,
writes a complete JSON artifact, and exits nonzero when generation or validation fails:

```sh
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --case simple-agent
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --suite smoke --min-chars 1200 --json
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --case forum --case ops-dashboard --repeat 3 --fail-fast
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --case ai-adventure --model sol
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --case simple-agent --tier behavioral
```

`--model` pins the generation model for the parent turn and every nested specialist. It accepts a
benchmark alias or the model id itself: `terra` / `gpt-5.6-terra` (default) and `sol` /
`gpt-5.6-sol`. The harness assigns each result a cohort key derived from its declared harness
contract version, exact provider/model/reasoning tuple, validation tier, and case-suite fingerprint.
The comparison guard rejects scores from different cohorts. Changing a model or fixture therefore
requires a new baseline; the cohort key does not claim that thresholds were recalibrated.

The default `structural` tier checks compiler receipts, persisted readback, and app structure.
`--tier behavioral` additionally requires host-produced scenario results from an attested isolated
runtime, complete assertions, and successful outcomes for every started run. The current desktop
host does not advertise runtime isolation, so this opt-in tier fails explicitly until a real
isolated adapter supplies that evidence. It never treats a transport acknowledgement as workflow
success.

Useful inspection modes do not start Tauri or spend model budget:

```sh
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --list
bun run flowpilot:e2e -- --case simple-agent --dry-run
```

By default Tauri starts the normal desktop Next dev server at `http://localhost:3000`. For a faster
edit/run loop, keep that Next server running and pass `--frontend-url http://localhost:3000` so the
CLI reuses it. Close any running Flow Like desktop app first: the native single-instance guard
rejects a second desktop process rather than risking concurrent writes to shared local app data,
and a CLI lock rejects parallel benchmark commands. `--keep-desktop` is available for debugging,
but that retained app must be closed before the next CLI run.

Child-process logs go to stderr, so `--json` reserves stdout for exactly one machine-readable result,
including on infrastructure errors. Use `--output /tmp/flowpilot-e2e.json` for a stable artifact
path. Exit code `0` means every requested run passed, `1` means at least one completed benchmark
failed, and `2` means CLI/startup/transport failure. The controller independently verifies the
selection and artifact order and recomputes the final summary instead of trusting the webview's
pass bit. It also recomputes behavioral run totals across every case and repeat and checks each
report against the requested evaluation cohort.

This is intentionally a thin controller, not a second FlowPilot implementation. Codex, GitHub
Copilot, Claude Code, and Bits still execute through the shared desktop global-chat and
`GlobalToolBridge` path; the benchmark policy pins one Codex model at `high` reasoning.

The live benchmark is available in a **development** desktop build at
`/developer/flowpilot-e2e`. It drives the real global-chat and frontend-tool bridge, pins the
selected Codex model with `high` reasoning for the parent turn and every nested specialist, and keeps
every generated app for inspection. Production builds fail the runner preflight before spending
model budget because detailed compiler evidence is intentionally disabled there.

Quick entry points:

- One case: `/developer/flowpilot-e2e?case=simple-agent&run=1`
- Default three-case smoke suite: `/developer/flowpilot-e2e?suite=smoke&run=1`
- Every case: `/developer/flowpilot-e2e?suite=full&run=1`
- Benchmark the other model: append `&model=sol` (the header toggle does the same for manual runs)
- Override the per-case non-whitespace character floor: append `&minChars=1200`

The heaviest case is `ai-adventure`: an offline AI text-adventure with a three-screen custom game
UI, two repeated widgets, six exactly named tables including a vector-embedded per-adventure memory
store, a savepoint/restore system, and a story agent that plans the campaign up front and then
generates scenes toward the persisted global goal. It exercises far more of the surface than the
single-purpose cases, so expect it to be the slowest and the strictest.

The same runner is callable from the desktop webview console:

```js
await window.flowPilotE2E.run({
  caseId: "forum",
  modelKey: "sol",
  minFlowScriptNonWhitespaceChars: 900,
});
```

Each returned/downloadable artifact includes the resolved prompt; byte-for-byte authored
FlowScript candidates; exact `check_flowscript` and commit receipts per app/board; canonical board
readbacks; parser and authoritative reconciliation results; app/UI/data/event inventory; persisted
node-capability and generated-ID checks; lower/upper compactness bounds; partial collector failures;
a stable failure fingerprint for grouping regressions; and the assistant debug trace. Live runs
spend model budget and create apps; the focused Vitest suite only tests case construction and
artifact evaluation.
