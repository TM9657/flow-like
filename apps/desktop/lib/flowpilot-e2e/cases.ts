		prompt: `Build an offline single-player AI text-adventure game. Everything runs locally: no cloud services, no invented API keys or hosts.

Create three pages named exactly "Adventure Menu", "Save Games", and "Play Scene".

"Adventure Menu" is the main menu. It lists every existing adventure as instances of ONE reusable widget named "Adventure Card" with "Open" and "Delete" actions, and it holds the new-adventure form: a free-text description input, a genre select (horror, fantasy rpg, sci-fi, mystery), and feature toggles (permadeath, companions, puzzles). Opening an adventure that already has savepoints must lead to "Save Games"; opening one without any savepoint must go straight to "Play Scene".

"Save Games" shows the selected adventure's savepoints as instances of ONE reusable widget named "Save Slot" with a "Load" action, newest-first, READ back from the table with a database read/filter node.

"Play Scene" renders whatever the current scene needs and nothing else: narration plus a continue control for a story scene, a choice list for single- and multiple-choice scenes, and a text input for free-form decisions. It also offers "Save" (a savepoint may be taken at any point) and "Restore last savepoint". When the player dies or fails, restoring must put the run back on the last savepoint's scene and state.

Set up physical scalar tables named exactly "Adventures", "Campaign Outline", "Scenes", "Decisions", and "Save Games". Every row must carry its adventure id so each adventure keeps its own isolated database. "Adventure Memory" is the lazy embedded lookup store: open it with the exact database alias \`adventure_memory\`, but do not pre-create it with a guessed vector size. Its first real embedding upsert must create it with a complete row and the embedding model's actual vector width. Chunk the campaign outline, every played scene, every character a scene introduces (kind "character"), and every recorded decision, embed those chunks, and persist them with their vector so the agent can retrieve them semantically.

Creating an adventure must generate the campaign BEFORE the first scene is played: from the description, genre and toggles, have the story agent produce the global campaign goal, a storyline outline, and a list of planned scene ideas, and persist them in "Adventures" and "Campaign Outline".

A story agent drives the game from then on. Build it from the model-preference node (leave the concrete preference inputs at their defaults for the user), give it a system prompt that carries the persisted global goal and outline, and register at least TWO function tools it can call: (1) a semantic lookup over "Adventure Memory" for relevant lore, characters and past decisions, and (2) a read of the campaign outline plus the most recent scenes from the tables. Invoke the agent for the NEXT scene and require its answer as structured JSON: scene kind (story, single choice, multiple choice, text input), narration, choices, the characters present, and whether the scene advances a planned outline beat or opens a new branch. Parse that JSON into a scene struct, persist it in "Scenes" with its adventure id, record the player's decision in "Decisions", and render the scene on "Play Scene". Every generated scene must stay consistent with the persisted global goal and outline.

Wire the real page, widget, widget-action, and table ids returned by the setup tools. Register every non-widget entry as an app event: the three page-load entries and each simple/generic entry (create adventure, submit decision, save, restore, delete) — at least five registrations in total. Widget-action handlers are bound at widget instantiation via fnRefs; they are not registrable app events, so leave them out of registration.

Handle an empty adventure list, a missing or empty save game, an empty decision input, and an agent answer that does not parse with clear states and messages.

Keep everything on one coherent workflow board. This app is far larger than one layer holds, so plan the decomposition BEFORE writing: every layer, including the board root, accepts at most 100 nodes, and each \`function name(...) { ... }\` declaration gets its own layer with its own budget. Keep the root layer to entry blocks and calls, put every sub-behavior in its own function, and prefer node-cheap construction (build a row from one JSON/struct-schema value instead of a chain of per-field struct writes). An edit that would overflow a layer is rejected whole and nothing is queued, so treat that diagnostic as a signal to split the layer, never as an edit to retry.`,
