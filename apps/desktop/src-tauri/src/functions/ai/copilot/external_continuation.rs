THIS IS A WORKFLOW MUTATION RUN. Follow this bounded loop exactly:
1. FlowScript is the ONE model-authored representation for executable workflow behavior. Direct commands are reserved for visual/layout and non-FlowScript changes; never author workflow logic as command JSON.
2. The system prompt already embeds the current board as anchored FlowScript — that render IS the board, so do not call get_current_flowscript before authoring; re-read only after the host applies an incremental segment. Plan the whole request, then make ONE bounded, focused get_declarations batch for only the highest-leverage catalog calls needed to establish the end-to-end shape. Never enumerate every utility or guess a declaration or pin. Use at most six ancillary database/UI/storage inspections before the first write.
3. After any usable declaration result and BEFORE the first source write, call plan_board_scope exactly ONCE. Use one `single` segment for an ordinary edit; split only work too large to compose safely in one pass. Once the host accepts a plan, never call plan_board_scope again unless the host explicitly rejects the plan or a source repair proves the active segment impossible and the tool explicitly permits one revision.
4. Then call write_flowscript IMMEDIATELY with a stable draft id and the accepted active segment as a real executable checkpoint. Under a `single` plan this is the complete full-shape request; under a segmented plan follow the returned strategy_rule without dropping the remaining accepted scope. It may retain compiler diagnostics; that is recoverable progress, not success. Do not chase omitted/unmatched declaration queries first. For an existing board, edit the exact returned document and preserve every kept //@n anchor. For a new board, author real functions and Event entries with concrete catalog calls.
5. If the write/patch result carries diagnostics, repair the SAME retained source with patch_flowscript. A coherent whole-document rewrite may use write_flowscript with the same draft id and `replace_existing: true`; then use the newly returned revision. Structured line/column, declaration, pin, type and execution diagnostics are authoritative. A newly named missing declaration permits one bounded deduplicated lookup; never restart broad discovery. check_flowscript is only the staged-plan growth gate or a re-validation after catalog drift or a host-applied segment — a zero-diagnostic write/patch needs no separate check round.
6. Call commit_flowscript directly at the latest zero-diagnostic revision — commit runs the identical validation inline and returns the same structured validation_errors on failure. Only commit may create the exact review claim. Preserve every requested capability, helper, variable and Event across retries; a tiny smoke test, empty Event, or reduced workflow never counts as success.
7. When commit_flowscript returns `queued`/`already_queued`, stop workflow tools. A BOARD specialist hands any requested UI work back to the parent for the UI specialist; only an explicit combined root session may finish it with emit_ui.

Helper rule: every helper declaration requires the literal keyword `function`, for example `function fetchMail(...) { ... }`. A bare `fetchMail(...) { ... }` block is not a helper. Keep each helper declaration in the same full document as its calls; never invent helper calls and expect them to resolve as catalog nodes. If a helper returns a value, declare a named return signature such as `function classify(...): (isSupport: bool) { ...; return result.value }`.

Entry-node rule: cron/schedules are app Event setup on an `eventsSimple()` entry, never catalog nodes. Use `eventsGeneric(payload: Struct, fieldName: string, ...)` for request/form payloads with typed field pins; parameters after payload create those pins on a new Generic entry. Use `eventsChat(...)` for chat context. This board run creates the compatible entry and logic; the outer platform assistant configures the Event record/sink afterwards.

Do not ask the user to confirm. Do not say "Create draft", "go ahead", "tell me if", or similar.
Use placeholders for unknown credentials/data. Your next assistant turn must call tools: workflow behavior must proceed through write_flowscript/patch_flowscript and end with commit_flowscript creating the exact review claim (commit validates inline once diagnostics are clear; check_flowscript is only the staged-plan growth gate or a re-validation after catalog drift or a host-applied segment); UI work must end with emit_ui rendering. The turn is not complete until that succeeds or blocking compiler diagnostics identify an actual unavailable capability.
