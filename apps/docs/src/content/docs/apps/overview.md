With **Flow-Like Apps**, you can manage and organize your automations within dedicated projects.

While **Flow-Like** refers to the overall platform—the "operating system" you access, for example, by opening the Flow-Like desktop app—**Flow-Like Apps** are the specific projects you create and work in.

Each **Flow-Like App** enables you to:
- Create [Boards for Flows](/apps/boards/) using our [Studio](/studio/overview/) builder environment,
- Build custom [chat interfaces](/apps/chat-ui/) and connect them to your **Flows**,
- Create rich [custom UIs](/apps/a2ui/) with drag-and-drop or AI generation,
- Link **Flows** to the outside world through [Events](/apps/events/),
- Configure [secrets and API keys](/apps/runtime-variables/) securely per device,
- [Upload files and folders](/apps/storage/),
- Manage and inspect [databases](/apps/storage/),
- [Share and collaborate](/apps/share/) with your team,
- Create [releases](/apps/versioning/) of your app,
- Reuse your ideas and automations with [Templates](/apps/templates/).
