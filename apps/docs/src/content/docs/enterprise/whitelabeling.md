Flow-Like's white-label program lets you deploy a fully branded workflow automation platform — under your name, on your infrastructure, for your customers.

## What is White-Labeling?

White-labeling means taking Flow-Like and making it yours. Your customers see your brand, your logo, your domain — while you benefit from Flow-Like's battle-tested workflow engine under the hood.

**You get:**
- Complete brand replacement (logo, colors, name)
- Custom domain deployment
- SSO integration with your identity provider
- Full source code access
- The right to sublicense to your customers

## Two Approaches

### 🔧 Embed the Workflow Engine

**Integrate Flow-Like's core into your existing product.**

Perfect for SaaS companies that want to add workflow automation to their platform without building from scratch.

| Rust Core Library | High-performance workflow execution engine |
| Visual Editor Component | Embeddable React workflow designer |
| REST API | Execute and manage workflows programmatically |
| Node Catalog | 200+ pre-built nodes for common operations |

**Use cases:**
- Add workflow automation to your SaaS product

### 🎨 Full Platform White-Label

**Deploy Flow-Like as a complete branded product.**

Perfect for agencies, consultancies, and enterprises who want to offer workflow automation under their own brand.
