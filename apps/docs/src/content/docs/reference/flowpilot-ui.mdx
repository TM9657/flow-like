# FlowPilot UI Generation

FlowPilot is an AI assistant that can generate, modify, and refine A2UI interfaces based on natural language descriptions.

## Overview

FlowPilot enables you to:

- **Generate complete UIs** from text descriptions
- **Modify existing components** with contextual understanding
- **Iterate quickly** through conversational refinement
- **Learn patterns** from your existing designs

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing FlowPilot

FlowPilot is available in multiple contexts:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Widget Builder" icon="pencil">
    Click the FlowPilot icon in the toolbar while editing any widget.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Page Editor" icon="document">
    Open FlowPilot from the page settings panel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flow Editor" icon="rocket">
    Use FlowPilot within A2UI flow nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat Interface" icon="comment">
    Start a conversation from the main FlowPilot panel.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Your First UI Generation

<Steps>

1. **Open FlowPilot**

   Click the FlowPilot icon or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`.

2. **Describe Your UI**

   Type a natural language description:
   ```
   Create a user profile card with avatar on the left,
   name and email on the right, and a follow button below
   ```

3. **Review the Result**

   FlowPilot generates the A2UI structure and shows a preview.

4. **Iterate**

   Refine with follow-up requests:
   ```
   Make the avatar circular and add a verified badge
   ```

5. **Apply Changes**

   Click **Apply** to insert the generated UI.

</Steps>

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Good">
    ```
    Create a card with:
    - Header showing product name and price
    - Image gallery with 3 thumbnail images
    - Add to cart button with quantity selector
    - Shipping estimate text below
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Less Effective">
    ```
    Make a product card
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Include Context

Reference existing elements and data:

```
Using the /product data, create a details page with:
- Hero image from /product/images/0
- Title from /product/name
- Price with discount badge if /product/onSale is true
- Description collapsible section
- Related products grid at the bottom
```

### Specify Styling

Include visual requirements:

```
Create a modern dashboard card with:
- Dark theme compatible (use dark: variants)
- Subtle shadow and rounded corners
- Gradient accent on the left border
- Responsive: stack vertically on mobile
```

---

## Generation Modes

### Create New UI

Generate a complete new interface:

```
Create a settings form with:
- Profile section (avatar upload, name, email)
- Notifications section (toggle switches)
- Privacy section (checkboxes)
- Save button at the bottom
```

### Modify Existing

Select a component and request changes:

```
Add a loading skeleton to this card that shows when
/isLoading is true
```

```
Convert this list to a responsive grid with
2 columns on tablet, 3 on desktop
```

### Extend Structure

Add new elements to existing UI:

```
Add a footer to this card with:
- Timestamp on the left
- Share and bookmark icons on the right
```

---

## Working with Data

### Data Binding

FlowPilot understands data paths and can create bindings:

```
Create a user list that iterates over /users and shows:
- Avatar image from each user's profile
- Name and role
- Last active timestamp
- Online status indicator
```

### Conditional Rendering

Request conditional visibility:

```
Show an "Admin Badge" next to users where /user/isAdmin is true

Add an error message that only appears when /form/errors
has items
```

### Dynamic Styling

Apply data-driven styles:

```
Color the status badge:
- Green when /status is "active"
- Yellow when "pending"
- Red when "error"
```

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Form Generation

```
Create a checkout form with:
- Shipping address fields (name, address, city, state, zip)
- Payment method selection (credit card, PayPal)
- Credit card fields with validation
- Order summary with item list and totals
- Place order button

Validate required fields and show inline errors
```

### Dashboard Layouts

```
Create a analytics dashboard with:
- 4 stat cards in a row (visitors, revenue, orders, conversion)
- Line chart for traffic over time (full width)
- Two columns below: recent orders table (left), top products (right)
- All cards should have consistent styling and spacing
```

### List/Detail Patterns

```
Create a master-detail layout:
- Left sidebar (1/3 width) with searchable list of /contacts
- Right panel (2/3 width) showing selected contact details
- Show placeholder when no contact is selected
- Highlight the selected item in the list
```

---

## Style Guide Integration

### Using Design Tokens

Reference your design system:

```
Use our brand colors:
- Primary buttons should use bg-brand-500
- Text should use text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100
- Cards use shadow-card with rounded-brand radius
```

### Component Patterns

Request consistent patterns:

```
Follow our card pattern:
- 24px padding, 8px border radius
- Subtle border in light mode, no border in dark
- Hover state with slight elevation
```

---

## Iterative Refinement

### Making Adjustments

After initial generation, refine with follow-ups:

```
Initial: Create a pricing table with 3 tiers

Refinement 1: Add a "Most Popular" badge to the middle tier

Refinement 2: Make the middle tier slightly larger and highlighted

Refinement 3: Add a toggle to switch between monthly/yearly pricing
```

### Undo and Variations

Request alternatives:

```
Show me 3 different layout variations for this card

Try a more minimal version with less visual elements

What would this look like with a horizontal layout instead?
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ Provide specific requirements
- ✅ Include data paths for dynamic content
- ✅ Mention responsive and dark mode needs
- ✅ Reference existing patterns in your app
- ✅ Iterate in small steps

### Don'ts

- ❌ Expect pixel-perfect results first try
- ❌ Skip accessibility requirements
- ❌ Forget mobile/responsive needs
- ❌ Generate overly complex nested structures
- ❌ Ignore your design system

---

## Common Use Cases

### Quick Prototyping

```
Quickly sketch out a:
- User onboarding flow with 4 steps
- Settings page with 5 sections
- Product listing page with filters
```

### Component Creation

```
Create reusable components:
- Alert banner with dismiss button
- Empty state with icon and action
- Loading skeleton for card content
```

### Layout Templates

```
Generate starter layouts:
- Two-column layout with sidebar navigation
- Dashboard grid with resizable panels
- Full-screen modal with header/body/footer
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Unexpected Results

If the output doesn't match expectations:

1. **Be more specific** - Add detail about structure
2. **Show examples** - Reference existing components
3. **Break it down** - Generate in smaller pieces
4. **Check data paths** - Ensure paths are correct

### Performance Issues

For complex UIs:

- Generate sections separately
- Avoid deeply nested structures
- Use list virtualization for long lists

---

## Integration with Development

### Exporting to Code

Generated A2UI can be:

- Used directly in the Widget Builder
- Exported as JSON for version control
- Integrated into flow-based applications

### Version Control

Track FlowPilot-generated UIs:

- Widgets are versioned automatically
- Changes create new versions
- Rollback to previous versions if needed
