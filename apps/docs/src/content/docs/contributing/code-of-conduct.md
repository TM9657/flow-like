Our goal is to empower people by providing tools that simplify and standardize coding and innovation. This Code of Conduct ensures our community stays focused on delivering quality work and supporting our mission.

## Our Expectations
We welcome anyone committed to the craft, regardless of background. Here’s what we expect from everyone:
- **Focus on Quality**: Contribute well-written code, share valuable insights, and support others in their efforts.
- **Stay Constructive**: Keep discussions relevant to the project and avoid distractions or personal disputes.
- **Be Respectful**: Offer honest feedback, accept suggestions professionally, and communicate clearly.
- **Maintain a Positive Environment**: Avoid disruptive behavior that undermines collaboration or progress.

Unacceptable actions include:
- Posting irrelevant or off-topic content that disrupts workflow.
- Engaging in harassment, threats, or personal attacks.
- Sharing private information (e.g., emails or contact details) without permission.
- Any conduct that hinders the community’s ability to work effectively.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, comments).
- Communication channels (e.g., email, Discord, or other platforms).
- Public interactions tied to the project (e.g., presentations or social media).

## Your Responsibilities
- Uphold these guidelines in all your contributions.

Reports will be handled discreetly and promptly.

## Enforcement
Violations will be addressed as follows:
- Initial incidents may result in a warning and a request to adjust behavior.

- Illegal actions will be reported to relevant authorities if necessary.

Maintainers will review incidents and apply measures fairly to protect the community’s goals.
