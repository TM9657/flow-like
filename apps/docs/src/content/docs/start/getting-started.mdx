Welcome to Flow-Like! This guide will have you building your first workflow in minutes.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Download Flow-Like**

   Get the desktop app for your platform:
   - [Windows](https://flow-like.com/download) — `.exe` installer
   - [macOS](https://flow-like.com/download) — `.dmg` for Intel and Apple Silicon
   - [Linux](https://flow-like.com/download) — AppImage or `.deb`

2. **Launch and Create Your First App**

   Open Flow-Like, click **New App**, and give it a name. You'll land in the Studio — your visual workspace for building flows.

3. **Add Your First Nodes**

   Right-click the canvas to open the node picker. Try adding:
   - A **Text** node (to input some data)
   - A **Log** node (to see output)

   Connect them by dragging from the output pin to the input pin.

4. **Run Your Flow**

   Click the **Play** button. You'll see your text flow through the graph, with each step recorded in the log panel.
