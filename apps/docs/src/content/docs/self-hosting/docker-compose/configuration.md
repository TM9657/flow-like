Generate `apps/backend/docker-compose/.env` with `scripts/setup-env.py`, then
maintain it as private deployment configuration. The checked-in `.env.example`
contains names and defaults, without working secrets. Setup refuses to overwrite
an existing file.

Use `KEY=value` assignments. The helper scripts reject duplicate keys and
shell commands; do not treat the file as a shell script.

## Public and private URLs

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for published listeners |
| `WEB_PORT`, `API_PORT`, `SIGNALING_PORT` | `3001`, `8080`, `4444` | Edge proxy ports |
| `PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Client-facing API origin |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URL` | `http://localhost:3001/callback` | OIDC login callback |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_LOGOUT_URL` | `http://localhost:3001/` | Post-logout URL |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3001` | Exact API browser origins |
| `REALTIME_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3001` | Exact signaling and storage CORS origins |
| `API_BASE_URL` | `http://execution-callback:8080` | Private execution callback origin |
| `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` | `http://s3.localhost:9000` | Exact signed object origin |

Keep the private callback origin distinct from the public API URL. The execution
proxy enforces callback paths against that private origin.

For public hosting, terminate TLS at a maintained reverse proxy and configure
its trusted addresses in `proxy/nginx.conf` before accepting forwarded client
headers. The supplied proxy overwrites client-provided forwarding headers.
Recreate `web` after changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values. Compose maps them to the
web image's public runtime URL settings; an image rebuild is unnecessary.

API CORS origins cannot contain wildcards, credentials, paths or query strings.
Add desktop origins to both origin lists when required:
`tauri://localhost,http://tauri.localhost,https://tauri.localhost`.

## Images

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOW_LIKE_IMAGE_TAG` | `dev` | Tag used for every empty `*_IMAGE` value |
| `API_IMAGE`, `WEB_IMAGE`, `DB_INIT_IMAGE`, `COMPILER_IMAGE`, `SIGNALING_IMAGE`, `SINK_SERVICES_IMAGE`, `OBJECT_STORE_INIT_IMAGE` | empty | Full image reference override |
| `RUNTIME_IMAGE` | empty | Runner and queue-bridge image |
| `EXECUTION_MANAGER_IMAGE` | empty | Manager and gateway image |
| `SANDBOX_IMAGE`, `SANDBOX_GATEWAY_IMAGE` | empty | Immutable references the manager starts per execution |

An empty `*_IMAGE` renders
`ghcr.io/rheosoph/flow-like-docker-compose-<workload>:${FLOW_LIKE_IMAGE_TAG}`.
The tag must match `[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]{0,127}`. Channel tags such as
`dev`, `beta` and `latest` move with each publication; release tags such as
`1.4.0` and immutable `sha-<commit>-run-<run>-<attempt>` tags do not. See
[Containers](/self-hosting/containers/) for the full scheme. The self-hosted
packages are public; cloud-provider packages are not.

`scripts/pull-images.py` pulls the nine images at one tag and writes their
`repository@sha256:...` digests into the `*_IMAGE` values, records the tag in
`FLOW_LIKE_IMAGE_TAG` and copies the runtime and execution-manager pins into
`SANDBOX_IMAGE` and `SANDBOX_GATEWAY_IMAGE`. Preflight rejects a digest-pinned
`SANDBOX_IMAGE` that differs from `RUNTIME_IMAGE`, and a digest-pinned
`SANDBOX_GATEWAY_IMAGE` that differs from `EXECUTION_MANAGER_IMAGE`, so the
queue bridge, manager and sandboxes always run the same build. Bare
`sha256:<id>` values written by `prepare-images.py` are local image IDs and are
exempt from that comparison.

Set a `*_IMAGE` value explicitly to use a mirror, a fork or a locally built tag.
`up.py --build` builds from the checked-out sources: it first writes
`flow-like-<workload>:local` into every empty `*_IMAGE` so the build never
shadows a published name on that daemon, then runs `docker compose up --build`.
It cannot build digest-pinned references. A plain `docker compose build` with an
empty `*_IMAGE` tags the local build under the published name, and later
`up.py` runs keep using it because Compose only pulls missing images;
`pull-images.py` restores the published digests.

## Hub configuration and identity

`FLOW_LIKE_RUNTIME_CONFIG_FILE` selects the host-side JSON file mounted into the
API and sink services at `/app/flow-like.config.json`. The API selects that mount
through `FLOW_LIKE_CONFIG_FILE`. Replace the example's OIDC authority, client
settings, public domains, legal links and signaling URL. The API reads the whole
document once at startup. Recreate the affected services after changing the file.

Alternatively, supply `FLOW_LIKE_CONFIG_JSON` or
`FLOW_LIKE_CONFIG_SECRET_REF` through the API's configured SecretStore, and set
`FLOW_LIKE_CONFIG_FILE=` explicitly. The Compose default preserves this empty
value. More than one nonempty source fails preflight and API startup.
`setup-env.py` selects this alternate source automatically when JSON or a
reference is supplied in its environment. A secret reference requires its value
to be available inside the API container.

Sink services still reads `supported_sinks` from the mounted file. Keep that
setting aligned with the API when selecting JSON or a SecretStore reference.
Do not print rendered Compose configuration containing environment-based JSON.
See the [runtime API contract](/self-hosting/containers/#runtime-api-configuration)
for document limits, secret references and failure behavior.

If all three runtime sources are empty, the API uses its compiled public
fallback. `FLOW_LIKE_CONFIG` remains an optional repository-relative local-build
fallback input. Never put deployment credentials in it or publish them in an
image.

The `signaling` service exchanges collaboration offers, answers and ICE
candidates. The hub's optional `realtime.ice` setting can configure Cloudflare
TURN credentials:

```json
"realtime": {
  "ice": {
    "provider": "cloudflare",
    "turn_key_id_secret_ref": "CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID",
    "turn_key_api_token_secret_ref": "CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN",
    "ttl_seconds": 14400
  }
}
```

Set those two secrets in `.env`. The API resolves them through its secret
store and supplies temporary ICE configuration to clients. Restart the API
after changing the hub configuration or rotating the long-lived TURN key.
Leaving `realtime.ice` null provides no managed TURN relay.

See [Realtime signaling](/self-hosting/signaling/) for replica fanout, upgrade
compatibility and proxy-header requirements.

## Execution mode and capacity

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXECUTION_ISOLATION_MODE` | `per_run` | One gVisor sandbox per execution |
| `COMPOSE_PROFILES` | `per-run` | Manager, gateway and queue-bridge services |
| `EXECUTION_BACKEND` | `http` | Interactive dispatch |
| `ASYNC_EXECUTION_BACKEND` | `redis` | Background dispatch |
| `EXECUTOR_URL` | `http://execution-gateway:9000` | Internal manager load balancer |
| `EXECUTION_MANAGER_REPLICAS` | `1` | Independent managers on this daemon |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS` | `10` | Active runs per manager |
| `SANDBOX_WARM_POOL_SIZE` | `2` | Additional unused slots per manager; minimum 1 |
| `SANDBOX_CREATE_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Parallel preparation per manager |
| `SANDBOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | Maximum unused-slot age |
| `EXECUTION_MANAGER_WORKER_THREADS` | `2` | Tokio workers, independent of run count |
| `SANDBOX_MEMORY_MB`, `SANDBOX_CPUS` | `1024`, `1` | Runner memory and CPU limits |
| `SANDBOX_PIDS`, `SANDBOX_TMP_MB` | `128`, `256` | Runner PID and temporary-filesystem limits |
| `QUEUE_BRIDGE_REPLICAS`, `QUEUE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | `1`, `10` | Background dispatchers and concurrency |

`SANDBOX_IMAGE` and `SANDBOX_GATEWAY_IMAGE` must identify immutable images
already available to the daemon. `scripts/pull-images.py` pins published
digests; run `scripts/prepare-images.py` instead after changing runner or
gateway code locally.

Only exact HTTPS integration hosts in `EXECUTION_ALLOWED_HTTPS_HOSTS` are
permitted in addition to the run's callbacks and storage. Configure supported
HTTP clients to use the supplied proxy. Raw TCP/UDP access is unavailable.

`API_REPLICAS`, `WEB_REPLICAS`, `COMPILER_REPLICAS` and
`SIGNALING_REPLICAS` scale those services separately. Resource limits use their
corresponding `*_CPUS` and `*_MEMORY` settings. See
[Scaling](/self-hosting/docker-compose/scaling/) before increasing counts.

For a separate trusted installation, generate with `--mode trusted`. This
selects `trusted_shared`, the `trusted` profile and
`http://runtime-gateway:9000`. `RUNTIME_REPLICAS` applies only to that shared
mode. Preflight rejects mixed execution profiles.

## Execution and credential lifetimes

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3600` |
| `SANDBOX_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` |
| `EXECUTION_TERMINAL_GRACE_SECONDS` | `60` |
| `EXECUTION_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` |
| `EXECUTION_STOP_GRACE_PERIOD` | `65m` |
| `EXECUTION_QUEUE_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` | `300` |
| `EXECUTION_CREDENTIAL_MARGIN_SECONDS` | `120` |
| `STS_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`, `CHANNEL_TTL_SECONDS` | `7200` |

Actual remaining credential lifetime must cover queue wait, execution, startup,
terminal acknowledgement, cleanup and the margin. Cache hits receive the same
check. There is no automatic credential renewal. Increasing run duration requires
a matching review of provider limits, channel lifetime and stop grace.

`REDIS_EXECUTION_QUEUE=exec:jobs:v3` selects the current queue protocol.
`EXECUTION_QUEUE_MAX_DEPTH=10000` bounds ready, pending and quarantined entries
together. Do not change queue names or clear retained entries as a way to bypass
capacity or uncertain execution results.

## Datastores and secrets

The bundled Redis instance uses separate API, runtime, signaling, sink and
metrics ACL identities. Setup generates each password. Redis uses AOF persistence
with one-second fsync and `noeviction`; memory pressure causes command failures
instead of evicting execution state.

`DATABASE_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10` applies per API replica.
`POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS=100` is the bundled server limit. Preflight includes
rollout overlap and administrative connections in its comparison.

The generated `BACKEND_KEY` stays in the API. Runners receive
`BACKEND_PUB` and a signed execution capability. Keep the manager token,
maintenance token, storage root keys and sink secrets outside workflows.

The bundled S3 settings select `STORAGE_PROVIDER=aws`,
`RUNTIME_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=aws` and `S3_STS_PROVIDER=rustfs`.
The stock API includes the required AWS feature. In this configuration, empty
AWS bucket overrides fall back to the generic names; an empty
`CDN_BUCKET_NAME` falls back to the content bucket.
See [Storage](/self-hosting/docker-compose/storage/) for external providers.

For external PostgreSQL/Redis, add `docker-compose.external-datastores.yml`
to `COMPOSE_FILE`, set `DATASTORE_MODE=external` and supply
`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `RUNTIME_REDIS_URL`,
`SIGNALING_REDIS_URL`, `SINK_REDIS_URL` and `METRICS_REDIS_URL`.
Apply reviewed schema changes explicitly with `docker compose run --rm db-init`.
The overlay removes automatic initialization; it does not move existing data.

Percent-encode credentials in connection URLs. The schema updater uses guarded
Prisma `db push`; versioned PostgreSQL release migrations and automatic schema
rollback are not implemented. Review each change and verify restore before
rolling API instances onto the new schema.

## Compiler, event services and model providers

The deployment implements HTTP compilation:
`COMPILATION_BACKEND=http` and
`COMPILER_URL=http://compiler-gateway:8081`. There is no compiler Redis
consumer. Defaults allow two concurrent compilation jobs and two parallel
targets per job, with a 600-second request timeout.

Setup generates `SINK_SECRET`, `SINK_TRIGGER_JWT` and
`SINK_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Enabled event adapters come from the hub
configuration. Preserve the encryption key while stored sink credentials use it.

Model-provider keys and endpoint variables are listed in `.env.example`.
Populate only the providers your installation uses, and keep their secrets out
of hub JSON.

## Runtime cost estimates

App analytics and the admin usage dashboard price every run from its measured
duration. The reference sizing bills an x86_64 function holding 2 GB for the
whole run plus an arm64 function holding 1.2 GB for half of it, at AWS Lambda
list prices, including the per-invocation fee.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPUTE_COST_MULTIPLIER` | `1.0` | Scales the whole estimate for deployments whose functions are sized differently |

A deployment that reserves twice the memory of the reference sizing sets
`COMPUTE_COST_MULTIPLIER=2`. The API reads the variable once per process, so a
change takes effect on restart. Values that are not a non-negative number are
logged and ignored. The estimate covers compute only: storage, network and
managed services are not included, and usage limits still apply to AI spend
alone.

## Validate configuration changes

```bash
python3 scripts/preflight.py
python3 scripts/up.py
docker compose ps --all
```

`up.py` starts with `--no-build`; pass `--build` only for installations whose
nine `*_IMAGE` values are all local tags.

Use `docker compose config --quiet` when checking interpolation manually.
Rendered configuration without `--quiet` contains deployment secrets.
