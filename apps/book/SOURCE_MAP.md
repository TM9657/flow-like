# FlowBook source map

This file is the drafting evidence index for *FlowBook: A Developer's Guide to Flow-Like*. It records
where a chapter author should look before stating how the current product behaves. It is not
a replacement for reading the relevant source, tests, generated declarations, and release
notes at the version targeted by the book.

## Evidence policy

Use sources in this order when writing about current behavior:

1. executable tests and implementation code;
2. generated schemas and declarations from the same revision;
3. product documentation from the same revision;
4. founder and maintainer interviews for rationale and intent;
5. measurements or named case studies for performance, scale, cost, and operational claims.

Interview material is authoritative for history, motive, rejected alternatives, and product
doctrine. It is not sufficient evidence that a security boundary, deployment target, or
runtime guarantee is implemented in every execution mode.

Every drafted chapter should carry a version ledger containing the repository revision, the
Flow-Like release used by examples, the status of each changing capability, and the date on
which claims were checked.

### Capability labels

- **Current** — implemented on the named release and covered by suitable source or tests.
- **Preview** — usable, but incomplete, changing, or not yet supported across every surface.
- **Vision** — product direction or intended contract, not a claim about the current release.
- **Measured** — supported by a reproducible benchmark or a named, approved case study.

### Precise two-view doctrine

The defensible formulation for the first edition is:

> The canvas editor and FlowScript editor inside Studio are equal authoring views over one Flow model.

The current implementation persists a Board. FlowScript is parsed and reconciled into Board
commands; the Rust executor runs the resulting graph. Do not describe the text and graph as
two independently persisted programs, and do not describe FlowScript as a separate runtime.

### Code-verified Board ⇄ AST ⇄ text notes

- `BoardAst` is the typed, “lossless-as-possible” semantic pivot between a graph optimized for
  identity/execution and text optimized for reasoning. The language crate deliberately does not
  depend on the Board implementation; graph lowering and reconciliation live in core.
- Board lowering first makes catalog calls fully qualified, then derives imports only for repeated
  static calls whose opened names cannot collide. Ambiguous names remain inline as qualified calls.
- Rendering is canonical rather than style-preserving. Pure format is
  `render(parse(authored))`; the stronger graph-derived normalization happens when a successful
  Apply reloads source from the resulting Board.
- The current parser is a context-free lexer plus recursive descent for document structure and a
  Pratt expression parser. A shared nesting budget of 128 prevents pathological editor/API input
  from overflowing the process stack.
- Reconciliation compares the edited semantic model with the live Board and emits the existing
  command vocabulary. A tested anchored literal edit yields exactly one `UpdateNodePin`; untouched
  coordinates and side metadata survive because the Board is patched rather than rebuilt.
- Any authoritative diagnostic returns zero executed commands. Destructive edits require separate
  approval; valid commands are staged and rollback-backed before persistence.
- Secret-variable defaults never enter the AST and ordinary edits preserve the hidden value. The
  server also filters sensitive pins before rendering. Direct Desktop lowering does not currently
  run that same pin filter, so secret-variable omission is a stronger cross-path guarantee than
  universal sensitive-pin redaction.
- Board reroutes lower transparently and decorative Board comments are not source comments.
  Existing anchored Function signatures are currently immutable through reconciliation. A known
  ignored whole-fixture round-trip test also covers duplicated/cross-handler name collapse.
- Anchored variables, Events, modules, and Functions have verified in-place rename paths. A
  Function rename emits `RenameLayer` under the same layer ID. Its final name must remain unique in
  the module, and its existing call targets continue to use the stable ID. Written callers use the
  final Function name and final module path in that revision.
- One anchor assigned to two distinct entities fails preflight before Board lookup, including when
  the ID is absent from the current Board. A multi-output Event header and its immediate first
  arm-routing Branch are one entity and may repeat the anchor. After that check, ordinary node,
  variable, Function, and module anchor IDs absent from the current Board are reported as
  unavailable and treated as unanchored. Their resolver may create an entity or reuse one unique
  compatible target. Absent Event anchors retain specialized recovery. The reconciler re-anchors
  one compatible entry, optionally narrowed by its first still-live execution-body connection. It
  creates a fresh entry when zero or several candidates remain. Invalid Event metadata,
  incompatible live anchors, and ambiguous ordinary recovery still produce diagnostics.
- Selection-scoped editing is user-facing in Web and Desktop. The render expands selected nodes to
  their owning sections and transitively referenced Functions, retains variables and interfaces,
  and returns section anchors that limit the deletion diff on Apply.
- FlowScript reconciliation does not currently emit a complete Function or module layer-removal
  plan when its declaration is omitted. Do not teach declaration omission as boundary deletion.
  Use a text-visible node removal for deletion-guard examples.

Pre-publication verification should exercise array destructuring, complex union/intersection
schemas, explicit multi-execution outputs, large layers, reroute presentation, layout
preservation, path schemas, and numeric comparison lowering. These are test targets, not a
founder-supplied list of known parity gaps. Any unsupported round-trip found while producing
the examples should be reported and documented against the affected release.

### Code-verified document-anatomy notes

- The AST separates `use` declarations, interfaces, top-level variables, functions, and Event
  entries. The renderer always emits sections in that order and normalizes spacing, quotes, and
  optional separators.
- `use` changes name resolution against the active catalog; it does not install or approve a
  package. Parsing proves syntax, while catalog-aware reconciliation proves that calls, pins,
  types, identities, and graph changes resolve for the current App.
- Editable source normally includes `//@n`, `//@v`, and `//@l` identity anchors even though the
  low-level renderer defaults to clean text. Preserve anchors for entities that should retain
  their identity.
- Free-standing `//` comments inside function and Event bodies survive text parse/render, but
  top-level prose comments currently have no AST slot and body comments are not persisted as
  canvas comments by Board reconciliation.

### Code-verified type and schema notes

- The scalar surface is `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Date`, `Path`, `bytes`, `Struct`,
  `exec`, and `any`. Value shapes are normal values, `T[]`, `Map<string, T>`, and `Set<T>`;
  container shape participates in connection compatibility even when the element type is
  generic.
- Concrete data types and value shapes must agree at known pin boundaries. `any` maps to the
  platform's Generic type and remains deliberately permissive, while enforced Struct schemas
  are currently compared by normalized equality rather than structural assignability.
- This authoring check is strongest for typed wires and anchored boundary contracts. Direct
  literal arguments are not uniformly validated against their destination pin during Apply;
  editor diagnostics are best-effort and a typed runtime consumer may be the first hard gate.
- A type name that does not resolve to a declared interface can currently fall back to a
  schema-less Struct. Parser acceptance alone therefore does not prove nominal type-name safety.
- Typed Struct boundaries can project schema fields into dynamic pins through **Break Struct**
  and **Make Struct (Schema)**. Schema-less Structs stay open and use path-based **Get Field**
  and **Set Field** operations instead.
- Current schema-to-pin projection is narrower than the interface grammar: enum-only fields can
  become Generic and map-shaped interface properties can become Struct/Normal field pins. Keep
  those as schema-level facts unless release tests prove a more precise projection.
- A changed schema does not silently delete a still-wired projected field. Make/Break retain the
  stale pin and put an error on the node so the broken connection remains visible; an unwired
  stale field can be removed.
- Literal string brackets parse as Struct member access, so arbitrary schema keys render as
  `value["external-id"]`; numeric and dynamic brackets remain collection indexes.
- Dynamic **Get Field** returns `null` and `found = false` for an absent path. If an author ignores
  `found`, a downstream typed consumer may become the first operation able to prove the mismatch.
  Runtime conversion failures are logged with node attribution, and the current Runs view can
  focus that node from its evidence.

### Code-verified catalog discovery and migration notes

- Dropping a wire from a pin opens the Board menu with **Context Sensitive** enabled. Candidate
  nodes are filtered to those with an oppositely directed compatible pin; authors can disable the
  filter and can search names, friendly names, categories, descriptions, and pin labels.
- Known FlowScript receiver types narrow member completion: a string offers string methods and an
  integer offers integer methods. Unknown receivers intentionally show methods from every class,
  grouped by their expected type. Namespace completion, signature help, and auto-import edits are
  derived from the declaration index.
- Generated `.flow.d` files describe calls for people and tooling, but the syntax parser does not
  bind calls from that snapshot. Catalog-aware reconciliation against the live registry remains
  the semantic authority; a successful parse alone does not prove a callable node is available.
- The Board's current search order uses textual relevance and its unfiltered menu is alphabetical.
  Although node quality scores exist and are visible in node information, the picker and
  FlowScript completion do not currently rank alternatives by safety, permissions, performance,
  cost, or trust. That ranking remains Vision.
- Catalog synchronization preserves a placed node and reuses same-named compatible pin IDs and
  wires. It adds new static pins and preserves connections when widening a pin to Generic.
- The current unsafe-change path is less conservative than the intended doctrine: an ordinary
  removed pin is deleted, and a changed concrete type clears its connections and resets its
  default. Dynamic schema-minted pins have stronger protection and can retain wired stale pins
  with a node error. Do not promise uniform error annotation until static migration is aligned.

### Code-verified expression and sugar notes

- Binary operators select a catalog family from operand types. A known String plus Integer and a
  declared Generic (`any`) plus Integer are hard mismatches; no conversion node is inserted.
  Apply is atomic when reconciliation reports a diagnostic.
- Only an Integer literal can adopt a known Float operand's family. Separately typed Integer and
  Float values remain incompatible until converted explicitly.
- Current text-to-Board families cover String equality/inequality/concatenation, Boolean equality
  and composition, Integer comparison/arithmetic, and Float comparison/arithmetic. Important
  exceptions are Float equality/inequality, Boolean inequality, `|`, integer bitwise operations,
  and Integer division: some parse, some have explicit catalog nodes, but their operator mappings
  are absent or inconsistent. Keep them explicit until the registry is reconciled.
- Board-to-text currently includes Float equality and inequality in its sugar table even though
  text-to-Board and existing-source reuse deliberately exclude them because tolerance is
  meaningful. An untouched Float comparison graph can therefore render source that fails Apply
  even against the Board from which it was rendered.
- Operator rendering keeps the explicit node call when a trailing input is wired or has edited
  nonzero configuration. This preserves `ignoreCase: true` and additional concat inputs.
- `!x` parses into a Boolean Not call; `-x` canonicalizes to `0 - x`. Only `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and
  `/=` are accepted, and canonical rendering expands them into assignment plus a binary operator.
- A ternary materializes Types Select. Its runtime reads only the chosen data input, but it is not
  an Execution branch. Its current sugar recognizer assumes today's three-input Select shape and
  should be hardened if that node gains meaningful configuration.
- Template literals materialize String Format with dynamic placeholder pins. Board rendering uses
  the template only when the literal format, resolved placeholder set, and regenerated pin names
  match exactly; otherwise it preserves the explicit call.
- Struct field assignment feeds the prior Struct into Set Field and rebinds later references to
  `struct_out`. Earlier consumers retain their earlier producer; the runtime mutates an owned
  value and does not retroactively change an upstream pin.
- Generic Get Field has `value` and `found` outputs, but current Board lowering does not check which
  one is selected before rendering member-access sugar. Use an explicit call when `found` matters
  until this is corrected.
- The proposed mixed-operator UX is Vision: after a rejected Apply, offer separate explicit
  conversion repairs, then Apply and canonically render the chosen visible node. Do not silently
  choose numeric addition versus text concatenation.

### Code-verified control-flow notes

- `else if` is accepted when authoring and canonicalizes to an `if` nested in the preceding False
  arm. Named execution-arm blocks preserve the exact execution output names of a catalog node.
- Sequential For Each evaluates its array once, processes values in input order, and awaits each
  body chain before the next item. A child error ends that item path, is logged, and does not stop
  later items.
- Parallel For Each defaults to 30 active item/body-root tasks. A positive value bounds active
  tasks; non-positive means unlimited. It schedules remaining items after child failures, waits
  for all children before Done, and exposes no collected result whose ordering could be promised.
- Plain `@parallel for` and `while (condition)` preserve only hidden defaults. Custom concurrency
  or maximum iteration values render as explicit `control::parallelForEach` or
  `control::whileLoop` calls.
- While reevaluates condition dependencies before each body, runs at most 15 iterations by
  default, and silently activates Done if the condition remains true at that ceiling. It has no
  duration limit or Exhausted arm. Child errors are logged and later iterations continue.
- Sequential, parallel, While, and break-capable loop nodes currently absorb child errors and
  return Ok. As a result, Error evidence can coexist with a terminal Success run. This conflicts
  with the intended aggregate-failure invariant and needs explicit runtime coverage.
- FlowScript has no `break` or `continue` AST statements. For Each (Break) is a separate visual
  node controlled by a Boolean input and is not registered for structured loop lowering.
- Function `return` wires data sources positionally to Function boundary outputs and does not
  terminate execution. The safe supported shape is one final unconditional return. Event/handler
  return creates a terminal Return Result node for one branch and accepts one value.
- There is no platform-wide first/last rule for competing Event results. Synchronous collectors
  commonly retain the first emitted result, while context merging and UI state can retain the
  most recently merged or observed result. Publish one logical result path instead of racing them.
- Two statically identified round-trip edges need release tests before publication: a consumed
  While `iter` output can lose its handle name because While syntax has no binding, and duplicate
  same-named execution outputs use an indexed selector internally that the current renderer appears
  to normalize into a different label. Do not use either shape in worked examples yet.

### Code-verified runtime notes

- Normal execution follows topology: one ready target runs singly; several ready targets run
  concurrently, bounded by executor capacity. An unhandled failure stops its own successor
  path without cancelling sibling targets and marks the ordinary run failed after the
  siblings finish.
- Node-defined Success/Error outputs are normal outcomes. Studio's optional **Handle Errors**
  facility is the generic unexpected-error path; a completed recovery chain preserves
  node-attributed Error evidence but prevents that handled error from failing the run.
- Dedicated Parallel and Sequence control nodes currently catch or discard some errors from
  their child chains. Do not promise uniform aggregate run status across those nodes without a
  release-specific test.
- Persisted log rows contain messages, severity, timestamps, optional node/operation fields,
  and optional usage statistics. Normal execution attributes them to nodes; Debug log level
  provides timed node-execution records. Pin inputs and outputs are not automatically
  persisted, and arbitrary author messages are not universally redacted.
- Numbered Board snapshots are immutable, but the current Runs-panel Re-Run action invokes
  Latest with the old local payload. It does not restore historic package resolution, runtime
  values, profiles, credentials, stored data, external responses, or default-selected models.
  Remote run history currently does not return its separately stored input payload.
- Even an explicitly pinned Board fixes authored graph and configuration, not necessarily the
  catalog implementation across platform upgrades: compiled artifacts are registry-fingerprint
  bound and may be rebuilt through the current node registry.

### Code-verified state and configuration notes

- Every run creates fresh values from caller, Event, or Board configuration. Function locals are
  fresh per invocation; Flow variables can be shared across branches of one run. Parallel writes
  are serialized by the runtime lock but their winning order is not deterministic.
- Exposed `let` values are currently edited through Board configuration and Board-write
  permission. Do not promise a separate configuration-only role until the routes use the existing
  config permission flags.
- Web and Desktop runtime-value records use `${appId}:${variableId}` in local IndexedDB. No user ID,
  sync, logout cleanup, or application-level encryption is present in that store. Standard clients
  send non-secret runtime values to remote execution and deliberately omit secret ones.
- Interactive execution prompts when a saved runtime record is absent. The check is presence-only,
  and the core runtime still resolves missing inputs through Event value, Board default, then
  `null`. Universal typed fail-closed preflight remains an intended invariant.
- `@readonly` prevents definition/configuration edits today, but Set Variable does not inspect the
  editable flag. Runtime immutability remains an intended invariant.
- Secret defaults are omitted from rendered FlowScript and ordinary Board/Event reads; non-empty
  secret initializers are rejected. Once read at runtime, however, a secret travels as an ordinary
  value and can be exposed by an author-written log or result.
- For `lastSuccessfulSync`, use cache only when loss safely causes repeated work. Use a durable
  database record when loss can skip work, repeat an irreversible effect, or violate recovery or
  audit requirements. Choose reference-data storage by access pattern: file for bulk/static,
  cache for small derived/rebuildable data, and database/Data Studio for evolving/queryable data.
- A private provider profile is the implemented hosted OpenAI BYOK boundary. Server credentials
  are encrypted and hydrated only for execution; offline Desktop downloads a local copy under a
  different at-rest boundary.

### Code-verified function, handler, and cache notes

- Runtime purity is the absence of Execution pins. Before an execution node runs, the engine walks
  its input dependencies backward and schedules reached pure nodes in dependency order. A pure
  output with no consumer is inert; an impure call on the execution chain runs even if its data
  output is unused.
- FlowScript infers a Function layer's execution boundary from its body. Impure calls, Board
  variable writes, branches, loops, and calls to other impure Functions propagate impurity. This
  makes some deterministic functions structurally execution-driven.
- Every user function with a first parameter participates in typed method dispatch on that
  parameter. Catalog methods remain receiver-metadata-driven. Current graph lowering renders Call
  Function nodes in flat form, so authored method spelling may not survive round-trip projection.
- Agent tools are explicit references to eligible Event/handler entries. A plain Function layer
  has no trigger node and is rejected as a direct tool reference; the automatic thin Event shim is
  product direction rather than current implementation. Handler types inform the tool schema, but
  current generated properties are not marked required and there is no per-reference confirmation
  or authorization object.
- `@cache` is explicit and Function-only. A hit restores named outputs, activates continuation,
  and skips the body, including side effects. Caching an impure Function is allowed today, so the
  author must ensure the body is safe to omit.
- Function cache keys hash the stable layer ID plus successfully evaluated input names and values
  inside App/user scope and namespace. They do not hash implementation or output contracts.
  Changing code, dependencies, packages, models, configuration, or external data requires an input
  revision, TTL, namespace version, and/or explicit invalidation.
- Namespace invalidation must use the same scope and a non-empty namespace. It is not a barrier:
  an older in-flight miss may write afterward. A data revision in the key prevents that late value
  from serving callers on the new revision.
- FlowScript's bare cache defaults are `global`, 300 seconds, App scope; current visual enablement
  starts with an empty namespace and no expiry. Published examples should spell namespace and TTL
  until the views converge.

Avoid “super secure” and other absolute wording. |
| `SRC-WASM-SDK` | `packages/wasm/wit/flow-like-node.wit`; `packages/wasm/src/abi.rs`; `packages/wasm/src/manifest.rs`; language examples linked by the WASM docs | Node ABI, manifest fields, pins, host functions, and SDK contract | A declared manifest capability is only a security guarantee when runtime enforcement is verified. |

## Deployment and architecture

| Evidence ID | Primary repository sources | What it supports | Drafting cautions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SRC-ARCHITECTURE` | `apps/docs/src/content/docs/dev/architecture.md`; workspace manifests; `packages/core/`; `packages/executor/`; `packages/api/` | High-level component boundaries and shared Rust engine | An architectural directory proves implementation activity, not production readiness or feature parity. |

The repository does not currently substantiate a full StackIT or Cloudflare runtime deployment. |

Provider cost comparisons, claims about thousands of Apps sharing one to three cloud
environments, canary behavior, compliance posture, and maintenance savings belong in the
book only after INT-07 supplies a reproducible model or an approved case study. Describe the
platform contract first; label provider-specific optimization separately.

## Learning material and worked applications

| Evidence ID | Primary repository sources | What it supports | Drafting cautions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SRC-UNIVERSITY` | `apps/desktop/lib/university/courses/foundations/`; `apps/desktop/lib/university/courses/specialist/`; `apps/desktop/lib/university/courses/advanced/` | Existing pedagogy, terminology, exercises, incident/debugging sequence, and audience assumptions | Reuse concepts, not large passages. The book needs one continuous narrative and runnable fixtures rather than a course catalog. |
| `SRC-CAPSTONE-DOCS` | `tests/ast/ttwctnp08u18sg2z6nmcqqak.flow`; `tests/ast/ttwctnp08u18sg2z6nmcqqak.anchored.flow`; `tests/ast/ttwctnp08u18sg2z6nmcqqak.board` | An existing substantial document/agent Flow and its text/graph companions | Distill it into teachable stages. Do not print a roughly 500-line fixture as a single unexplained listing. |

The deterministic **Incident Triage** tutorial should become a new small book fixture. Its
minimum shape is event input → normalize → classify/branch → deliberate log or failure →
response. It must require no external account, model, or secret and should be tested through
parse, reconcile, text rendering, and execution where practical.

The **Incident Room** capstone should grow from `SRC-CAPSTONE-DOCS`, `SRC-RAG`, `SRC-CHAT`,
and `SRC-DATA-STUDIO`. `examples/sales-insights` supplies a later custom-node/widget case
study rather than replacing the main capstone.

## Open fact-check gates

The following statements are not approved as unqualified book claims yet:

1. **“Every Board round-trips losslessly.”** Say that the views preserve supported program meaning
   and untouched Board identity. Do not promise byte-for-byte source style, pixel-for-pixel canvas
   reconstruction, comment parity, or support for every Board shape.
2. **“WASM nodes are completely isolated.”** Verify resource limits, capabilities, ambient
   host access, consent, version trust, and every execution path in INT-05.
3. **“Governance scores show how good an App is.”** Resolve score direction, provenance,
   aggregation, and policy override in INT-06.
4. **“Every target has the same production-ready deployment.”** Classify each target as
   supported, preview, partial, or planned in INT-07.
5. **“AWS is cheapest and Azure is most expensive.”** Require a defined workload, region,
   architecture, date, pricing inputs, and reproducible calculation.
6. **“Ten thousand Apps need only one to three cloud rooms.”** Require an architecture model
   and operational case study, including isolation, quotas, failure domains, and ownership.
7. **“Audit and governance come for free.”** State what evidence is automatic, which failures
   are surfaced, what is configurable, and what still requires people and operating policy.
8. **“The node catalog contains N nodes.”** If useful at all, generate the number for the
   pinned release and label it as a snapshot.
9. **“Web, desktop, mobile, and embedded clients have parity.”** Establish actual supported
   authoring and execution capabilities per client.
10. **“FlowScript is 99% complete.”** Replace the percentage with a named parity matrix and a
    list of unsupported or lossy Board constructs.

## Drafting checklist

Before a chapter moves from outline to manuscript:

- answer its interview dependency in `INTERVIEWS.md`;
- read every cited source rather than relying on this summary;
- pin and run its examples against one repository revision;
- include both the FlowScript and graph representation for meaningful logic;
- test one relevant failure path;
- mark changing features Current, Preview, or Vision;
- move volatile signatures and exhaustive catalog material into generated reference links;
- attach measurements to performance, scale, cost, or security-strength claims; and
- add unresolved discrepancies to the fact-check queue instead of smoothing them over.
